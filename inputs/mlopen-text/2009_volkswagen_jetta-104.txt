2009 volkswagen jetta
Absolutely amazing car. I just traded a 2000 A4 for the Jetta, as the A4 was ridiculously overpriced. I was hesitant about getting the Jetta, after driving the A4 for 10 years, but one test drive, and I couldn't wait to trade the Audi in. I have had the Jetta one week, and am thrilled with it. It is fun to drive, easy to drive, comfortable, and utilitarian. I think this is the best kept secret in the auto world....
