2009 mitsubishi lancer
We've had our Lancer for six months. So far, not one complaint. No problems of any kind, and more importantly, we love to drive! It's got a tight ride, (glued to the road), takes a beating on terrible city roads, is peppy and looks sexy. It has more than adequate power and with the kicking sound system, it's more than fun to drive. I've bought 8 cars new since my 1982 driver's license, and by far I'm happiest with this one the most.
