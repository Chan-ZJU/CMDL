2009 nissan murano
Spent several months reseraching every other CUV/SUV on the market and the 2009 Murano continually popped up near the top of every criteria list. I quickly uncovered that this vehicle should not be compared to the Mazda CX- 7, Ford Edge, Toyota Highlander, etc., but rather the Lexus RX, Acura RDX/MDX, BMW X3/X5, etc. For the money, the performance, amenities, and overall driving experience that Nissan offers in the Murano cannot be beat in its class. I went with the LE because it offers everything, I would highly recommend the navigation option (no regrets). After a month of ownership and 2000 miles, I am still impressed by the ride quality and everything that this vehicle offers.
