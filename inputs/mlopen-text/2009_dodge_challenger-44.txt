2009 dodge challenger
it still garners a lot of attention when i take it out for a spin. it feels a little underpowered for a 4000 lb. car. my biggest concern is the problem i have sometimes shifting from 1st to second. it goes into fourth, and when i try to go into second, it prevents me and i end up shifting into third. but it puts the fun back into driving.
