2009 nissan rogue
We kind of got duped into this lease.Here's my list - I'm short and the Rogue has VERY cramped leg room for the drive, it actually makes me a nervous wreck, the head room is also tight  the steering wheel barely tilts. The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable (and I have the leather package), no adj. head rest(which also block visibility)  no seat adj in the back either. The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe - the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w/ a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility. No matter if you like how it drives or not, it is simply unsafe to drive. This long time Nissan owner can not WAIT for the lease to end  it's only 1 mo in!
