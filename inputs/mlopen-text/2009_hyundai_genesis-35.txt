2009 hyundai genesis
I have had the car since Sept 2008. I was very apprehensive about buying a Hyundai but loved the look and styling of the car. After the test drive and reading many reviews I was convinced to take the leap. 3 months later I am still amazed and loving this car. I have owned Lexus  Cadillac but this is my favorite yet.
