2009 nissan versa
After looking at the Versa Basic (Base+A/C) with Auto trans and ABS and nothing else (not even a radio) with MSRP of $12,965, my wife and I decided to purchase the $15,8xx 'S' model because it included a very nice $1,250 rebate AND had a higher markup between invoice and MSRP which allowed us to get a better deal. We wound up spending $1200 to get the upgraded interior, the upgraded engine, power locks/windows/doors, keyless entry, stereo, floor mats, cruise control,and alloy wheels. Basically $3000+ worth of features for $1,200. We love the car and wound up paying $14,200 at carmax. With the CARS program we got $4,650 for our 1985 dodge and the Versa S only cost us $9,550.
