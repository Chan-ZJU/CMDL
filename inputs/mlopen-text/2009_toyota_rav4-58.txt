2009 toyota rav4
We replaced My wife's 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee with our new RAV4. We live in the Hills in Connecticut and our 2.5L 4-cyl climbs the hills very well - so much better then our previous Jeep. Handling is superb. Gas mileage has been averaging 22.5 mpg, which is a little bit disappointing. Would highly recommend the mud guards which are about $58.00 at dealers cost. They prevent road grime being tossed up the side of the vehicle. Also they are easy to install. Overall this vehicle is a great buy for the money.
