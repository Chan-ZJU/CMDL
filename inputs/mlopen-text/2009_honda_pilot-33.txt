2009 honda pilot
When I had my 08 4WD EXL w/Nav Pilot at the dealership, I made the mistake of looking at the 09. Most expensive dealer service I've ever had because I bought an 09 4WD Touring w/Nav and RES a week later. I liked my 08 and it was serviceable, but I didn't love it. Everything I would have changed about the 08, Honda changed for 09. The joystick Nav system is so much better than the touchscreen. I LOVE THIS CAR, and it's a Honda. This is my 4th Honda. Can't beat their reliability.
