2009 mini cooper
I'm hooked. Even my daughter that wanted me to get a Saturn Sky is glad to have this car. It is true what people say, it really does handle like a go-cart. Super responsive and I just hit 1200 miles with a life to date MPG of 35.9. Power and handling are the most obvious features of this car. I will own a MINI from now on.
