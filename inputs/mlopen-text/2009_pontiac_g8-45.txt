2009 pontiac g8
The Pontiac G8 GT is the most fun blend of comfort, performance and style I have ever found in a car in this price class. It is my 1st brand new car of the lot, that is how highly I think of this car I risked to buy it new. It has tremendously good comfort, outstanding acceleration and low interior noise. I've put 4k miles on it in a month, and I'm extremely pleased with this vehicle, it has the best design and layout of the available space in the chassis. Comfortable dash and seats with superhigh quality feel, that was very lacking in previous years. I've had two Pontiac Grand Prix's before this, they served me well. But this is the NEW standard we see from GM. THANK YOU MR. LUTZ for the G8.
