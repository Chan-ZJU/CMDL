2009 nissan frontier
Truck looks good with good v6 power response. channel tie downs are great and will come in handy. hoping MPG will improve with break-in. vehicle is tight and doors fit good. there seems to be some oversteer on the hwy driving. transmission shifts good. would rather see electric engine coolins fans than the direct engine driven cooling fan.
