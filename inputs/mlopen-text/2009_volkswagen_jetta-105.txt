2009 volkswagen jetta
I was a reluctant VW buyer-I really wanted an Audi Avant but economic reality helped make the decision for me and I am very pleased with my purchase. I should state that I love European station wagons for their design, practicality and maximum space on a non SUV platform. I purchased a 2009 SE Jetta Wagon and whoever claimed they were "luxury economy cars" got it right. I once owned an Audi A4 and I loved it but this VW is as much fun! Forget the Passat wagon-if you love European wagons get this one and you will be thrilled at how much car it is for about $25,000!
