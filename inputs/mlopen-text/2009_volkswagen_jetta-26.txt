2009 volkswagen jetta
This car replaces a Honda Civic DX. When my wife said she wanted a new car, and it "had to get better mileage than her Honda", the search was on. We spend a couple of weeks a year in Europe, and know how developed the Turbo Diesel is in Europe. While Hybrid's are interesting, its repair costs are questionable - most likely one won't be repairing, they will be replacing components. I had heard from friends who have TDi's how much they liked them. The TDi is positioned as the top of the line model - with all of the bells and whistles. This car impresses me more every time I drive it. It accelerates at every speed with gusto, and averages about 44+ mpg on a 25 mile one way trip.
