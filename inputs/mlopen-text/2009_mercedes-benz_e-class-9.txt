2009 mercedes-benz e-class
I recently leased a silver E350 4- matic with the Premium pkg 1 and AMG sport appearance package and boy was it a great all rounder.It has great looks(courtesy AMG package), adequate performance(0 -60 in ~6 secs), and mileage(17-18MPG City), Advanced Tech features such as Voice activated Navigation, IPOD interface, Rain sensing wipers. Also the multi information display is right in front of you on the speedo which is a nice feature since you don't have to take your eyes off the road. I live in Colorado and wanted the 4-matic and i think that was a good decision. We had a couple of snow (spring)storms here and AWD worked just fine.The trick is to use the "C" setting for the transmission.
