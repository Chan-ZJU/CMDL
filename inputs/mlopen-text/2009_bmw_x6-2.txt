2009 bmw x6
Love the X6 - I think it's worth the extra $$ for the V8 - plus residuals are better and the money factors were too. Only wishes would be: 1. Manual transmission Option (Are you listening BMW!!) 2. 5th seat - middle seat in back, and 3. Handles above seats. I know it's supposed to be a "coupe" but c'mon, we need handles. I get more "stares" in this rig than I did in my M6 convertible. It surprisingly also feels faster than that vehicle. Fun car/SUV, whatever it is I love it.
