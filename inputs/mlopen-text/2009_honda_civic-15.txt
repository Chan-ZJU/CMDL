2009 honda civic
I'm a long time manual transmission driver and after an extensive search thought I'd found the perfect car. This car had the style and comfort unmatched in it's price and class. However, after two weeks of driving this vehicle the transmission started to get very notchy in second gear especially when cold. Once winter hit the problem became noticeably worse to the point that it actually jumped out of second gear on several occasions. By mid-winter I didn't want to drive this car anymore. I took it to the dealer but they could not duplicate the issue when the engine/trans was warm and they checked and flushed the trans fluid. I traded this car after 4 months and couldn't be happier.
