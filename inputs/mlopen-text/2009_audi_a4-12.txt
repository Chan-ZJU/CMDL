2009 audi a4
I've had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints, except for the wind (see below). The A4 drives well, though it's not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series. Steering is tight, brakes are just a bit grabby, and power is strong. The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering. And it's difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn't make noise. Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level.
