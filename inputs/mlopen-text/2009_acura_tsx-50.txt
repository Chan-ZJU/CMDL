2009 acura tsx
I have been driving German cars for the past 5 years, but rising gas prices made me look into an entry level sport-luxury sedan with a 4 cylinder NA engine. The TSX is unique in the market, and the car drives like a dream. It's light and agile-feeling, power with the 6 speed manual is good, the comfort is right on the money and the tech features are a bonus. The fuel economy so far is excellent! There seems to be some controversy surrounding the looks of the car, but park it next to a 2008 or earlier model, and it makes the old car look instantly dated. It definitely has more street and parking lot presence than the previous model.
