2009 honda civic
I have been looking and test driving Civics for the last 2 years and finally decided on a Crystal Black Pearl Coupe, it was on the showroom floor. I almost went with the LX-S, but decided that for an extra $1,300 I would rather have the sunroof, UBS connection with a great stereo, 4 wheel disc breaks. The car is very fun to drive and rides a lot better than the coupe a test drove. Will see how good the mileage is.
