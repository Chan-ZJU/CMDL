2009 dodge caliber
I guess compared to driving a 1998 Jeep wrangler for 8 years a moped would seem more economical. I'm not knocking my hot little black convertible it was just time to put it down. And it came at the absolute perfect time. With 218,000 miles I traded that Jeep for a brand new 2009 Dodge caliber. I got 3,500.00 for the clunker and then Dodge matched it with an additional 3,500.00. Best deal ever! I love it. I have air conditioning, speed, good gas mileage, and it's so quiet. I have to admit, I did cry when I had to give up the first car I had ever bought with my own money, and I still have the key, but what a difference. It really makes me appreciate the road. I love my new caliber
