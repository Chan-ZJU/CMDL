2009 audi a4
After months of study and countless test drives, I chose the Audi A4 quattro over the BMW 328xi and the new BMW 335d. As a previous BMW 3-series owner, I agonized over the decision. However, I cannot be happier. After owning it a few weeks, it has exceeded my high expectations. It is truly an incredible vehicle, with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for. After initially considering the base (premium) model with the add-ons I wanted, I ultimately opted for the prestige model with all the toys. The icing on the cake is that I paid thousands less than a comparably equipped BMW with better mileage.
