2009 toyota camry
Bought this vehicle just standard LE, without stability and traction control. Even then I feel it's very stable during exit turns at high speeds and does not rattle. this year Camry is as quiet as previous year models and compared to Honda Accord. Exterior looks are at par with Lexus and more lavish than Accord 08/09 models. Interior is comfortable, but at times I get with interior plastic finish a bit cheaper feel. Probable Toyota tried to compensate interior to implement newer EPA safety standards and expansive research for fuel economy by keeping car at almost same price of 2008.
