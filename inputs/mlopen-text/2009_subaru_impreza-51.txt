2009 subaru impreza
I am former Lexus IS 300 owner and wanted a similar sporty sedan. I am utterly impressed with the value this vehicle provides. I like how this package has everything you need without needing to purchase any extras for increased costs. Reasonably priced Japanese built car with amazing performance and decent looks. You cant go wrong and throw in the AWD while your at it. Pound for pound this blows my IS 300 out of the water with much greater value. The interior was nicer in the Lexus IS 300 but thats it.
