2009 lexus is 250
Before buying this I test drove a lot of vehicles, MB C class, BMW 335 and Infiniti, but IS has a different nice good taste to it, more stiff (in a good way) than MB, more stylish interior with same driving experience than BMW, more style than Infiniti (I think). Liked the exterior styling and standard features like fog light, LED lights, turn indicators on the side mirrors, side mirrors are heated too. I am really very very happy with my choice and recommend you all to test drive this to realize what a nice car it is. Its Lexus.
