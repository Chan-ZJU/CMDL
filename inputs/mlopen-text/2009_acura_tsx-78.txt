Ok I'm going to slam this car a little, because the voice activation system has major flaws, and this prevents you from being able to operate your hands free phone link. For whatever reason, there is no option to dial your calls out, without using the voice activation system (which means the car has to hear and understand your VERBAL commands). This means that when you can't get your verbal command through to the car, that you're basically not able to call out. For a luxury car, this is absolutely unacceptable. I understand this is new technology, but they could easily have allowed for a way to dial out calls without using the very flawed voice activation.
