2009 mazda mazda6
After looking at the malibu LTZ (v6), accord EX-L v6, and altima the choice was obvious for me. Mazda all the way. I have never owned a mazda, but the features and amenities are 2nd to none and with current manufacturer rebates/incentives, I simply couldn't walk away. I ended up getting my loaded mazda 6 grand touring at about 3400 under invoice. The mazda6 is still relatively new, so its nice to not be one of the crowd.
