2009 kia optima
I got this car for $17500 and im very happy with it, i've had it for 5 months and it has yet to break down or need work. I have 8500 miles on it and everything still seems like new! I wish Kia and Hyundai would replace the 2.7 V6, its underpowered (190 hp) and bad on gas for the power (20 city and 26 highway)! They should replace it with a 3.2 V6, more power for same fuel economy! The I-4 is enough its not that sporty but its Kia what do u suspect? I get 32mpg on the highway and 25 in the city, great milege. Kia did a great job with the design! Very modern. It was between the 09 Fusion, 09 G6, or the Optima, Optima won! Its a good deal go out and I strongly suggest you put this on your list.
