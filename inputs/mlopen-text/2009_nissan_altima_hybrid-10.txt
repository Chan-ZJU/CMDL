2009 nissan altima hybrid
Had the hybrid for 1700 miles. It has greatly exceeded my expectations. I am getting 38.3 mpg and as the engine breaks in, I expect it to go higher. The list price of $29k was a little steep, but with $3250 cash back by Nissan and a $2350 tax credit, I was able to get this vehicle, with the Convenience package for under $21k.
