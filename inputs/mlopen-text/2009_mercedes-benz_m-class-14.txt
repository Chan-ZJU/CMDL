2009 mercedes-benz m-class
Purchase this since we needed something relatively large - but were very concerned about getting a gas guzzler SUV. So far, so good - this SUV is a great solution. Getting 24+ on the highway and plenty of room and comfort. No quality issues so far, but it hasn't been long - initial build quality seems outstanding.
