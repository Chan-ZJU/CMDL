2009 nissan rogue
I am impressed with the exterior, very nice design giving the feeling of a luxury vehicle. The interior is basic but also attractive. Some things I found to be missing that were bothersome to me were: volume control on the steering wheel, one-click power- up window control (there is one-click down, but not up)and auto headlights, no navigation system. The seat adjustment controls, power steering and dash controls are basic. These features may be available if you purchase the premium package. The Rouge handles nicely, although it is loud upon acceleration and it is noticeably a 4 cylinder vehicle. The new technology transmission takes getting used to, the car can feel a bit "put-put."
