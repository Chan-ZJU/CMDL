2009 acura tsx
I recently traded my 04 TL for the 09 TSX and I am not yet convinced I made the right choice. I chose the new TSX because the new body style somewhat resembled my old TL which I absolutely loved. Also, the TSX had great gas mileage and the price with lots of accessories was unbeatable. However,I miss the power of my old car! The TSX takes a bit longer to get going after you accelerate. The ride is not as smooth as my other Acura. Also, although the design is much bigger, it still lacks leg room in the back seat. The old TLs still had more room. All being said, I do love the look of the new TSX and I am sure I will enjoy it more as the time passes. Saving $ on gas alone is a big plus!
