2009 honda accord
The car is very pretty but don't let the looks fool you. I only have 800 miles on the car and so far it's been a bad experience. I never bought a Honda before and I am disappointed in every way. After hearing all the great reviews from everyone I had to try. The car rattles on medium radio volume (about talking level, I don't like loud music). No brand new car should rattle. The audio quality is horrible. Poor, not as expected gas mileage (16 mpg with mixed highway/city driving). The windows constantly fog up and rear defroster doesn't work. There's also a lot of road noise! I should have spent the extra money to get something else.
