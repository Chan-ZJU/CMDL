2009 toyota venza
I perhaps am different that most, as I purchased this car to essentially carry stuff as I'm a weekend musician and needed a car capable of carrying quite a bit of equipment. I hate mini-vans and SUV's are horrible in terms of load-in and load-out (plus drive AWFULLY) so this or a Subaru were it. This car does what I wanted it for quite well. I didn't initially care for the handling of the car, as it feels heavy to me, but once I became used to the car it drove quite well. It drives quite well fully loaded with equipment as well as filled with adults. The stereo sounds great, the bluetooth and nav work well and the care is very comfortable. The more I drive it, the more I like the car.
