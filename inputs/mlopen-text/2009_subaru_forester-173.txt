2009 subaru forester
We have had our Forester about 3 weeks now and I am very impressed with the whole vehicle. It`s very comfortable and quiet. It just feels solid when your driving and, has great response in steering and breaking. We love everything about it so far. Have had compliments on body style and color, (sage green). First tank of gas avg. 24.3 mpg. combination city and highway. Also pleased with that. I was also surprised with the pep of the 4 cylinder after driving V6`s `s. No need for the Turbo in my opinion. If you are looking for a great compact SUV this is the one.
