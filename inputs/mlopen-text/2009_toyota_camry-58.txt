2009 toyota camry
I got the car with 0 miles on it and I'm the first one breaking this vehicle. I can say only great words for the comfort and space for this car, just two little remarks for the cruise control on the wheel and the light on the AC, heat, and the fan. Can see where exactly the ball is during the day. Other way great car to own.
