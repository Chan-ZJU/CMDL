2009 mercedes-benz c-class
I've owned many M-B's since 1984. This is a very nice car, but after a month, I wish I'd gotten the C350. I also have an '06 Porsche Carerra S Cab and just turned in an '07 E350. It has P1,P2,Nav,18's and Panoramic Roof. All that stuff works great, but the seats are not as comfortable as my E350 was. My two major gripes are the brakes and power. I do 70% freeway driving and at 65 mph, this motor has limited passing ability. Punch it and it makes a lot of noise, but takes an hour to get around a big rig, especially on an uphill grade. I guess it depends on what you're used to. Additionally, the car is 'underbraked'. You really feel the brakes straining to bring the car down when needed.
