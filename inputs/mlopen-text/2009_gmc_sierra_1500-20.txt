2009 gmc sierra 1500
I?ve had the truck for just about one month. At one month, every other vehicle that I?ve owned has had at least one little problem or there was at least one little thing about it that I didn?t like. I haven?t had any problems nor have I found any thing I don?t like with the Sierra. It is comfortable and fun to drive. I did a mileage check that came out at 19 MPG. I drive 70% highway and 30% city. At highway speed (60MPH), it is so quiet that I don?t need to turn up the stereo. The average load in the bed is 500 to 700 pounds and with that load the truck handles very well.
