2009 chevrolet traverse
I downsized from my Tahoe. I can confidently say this vehicle is the best I have ever owned. I do a lot of traveling for my company and the room in this vehicle accomodates for my stuff very easily. It is also extremely comfortable on those long road trips. I would definently reccomend this to anyone in the crossover market.
