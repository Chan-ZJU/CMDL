2009 honda accord
I bought my wife a 2009, Accord, EX-L, nav, with every option. We love the car. The car has Lexus and Infiniti styling at a fraction of the cost. More room than the M-series, and better mileage. This is our fourth Accord, and is our first leather Accord. The back seat room is incredibly large, and our sons are 6'2" and 6'4". Their legs don't touch the front seat. This is the best Accord that Honda has ever made. If I had the money, I would get two of them. Don't worry about the road noise. This car is pure quality.
