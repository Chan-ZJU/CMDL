2009 acura tsx
I kept going back  forth b/t the TSX and Honda Accord. Glad I went w/ the TSX. Very good pick up for a 4 cyl car (compared to 4 cyl Accord)  great gas mileage. If you're in the market, recommend taking it for a test drive. Also drove an older model RL....such a nice car if you have $. This is my 2nd Acura and I've had a great experience w/ both. HIGHLY recommend!
