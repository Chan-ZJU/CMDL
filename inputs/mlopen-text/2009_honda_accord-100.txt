2009 honda accord
My wife and I love the car. The standard safety features are excellent. We first planned on getting a LX, but chose an EX instead for its upgraded engine and moonroof, both of which are worth the extra money. Having owned a Camry in the past, we are extremely pleased with Accord's driving performance and how we 'feel the road.' Don't worry about the road noise or seat comfort (lack of). We also looked at Altima, Camry, and Prius, but we thought Accord had the best overall value. Go and test-drive for yourself.
