2009 dodge challenger
Ive been watching these since the concept car in 06 (owned Cudas and Challengers as a young man). I finally drove one and left the lot with it. Ive owned Vettes and Saabs and this car blows them away. I can't wait each day to go fire her up. Manual transmission is fantastic. Sometimes forget it has the 6th gear. Very comfortable, smooth ride. Handles like a dream. With current incentives it made this car more affordable (comes with lifetime drive train warranty). Having owned old style Cudas and Challenger the upgrades done on this modern Challenger are superb. Many people give the thumbs up or stop me to ask questions. This is a keeper.
