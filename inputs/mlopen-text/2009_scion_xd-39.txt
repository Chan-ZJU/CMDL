2009 scion xd
It is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage (43 mpg, first fill up) and hauls my wife, two labs and groceries with no problems. Salesperson was wonderful - no surprises and all the tech info I needed. I would recommend this car and dealer to anyone wishing for max value and pleasant, safe and fun driving.
