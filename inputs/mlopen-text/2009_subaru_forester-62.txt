2009 subaru forester
After driving 2 CRV'S (98  03) fo 10yrs. I was waiting for the Honda Element redesign, it looks like 2009 isn't the year. So I checked out the Scion XB not impressed. I saw one of these on the road and their TV commerical. Decided to check it out. Took a test drive and was sold. What a difference from driving CRV's. I had forgotten how much fun driving could be. My first AWD all I can say is wow
