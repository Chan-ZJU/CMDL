2009 mitsubishi outlander
After a lot of research on Edmunds about the Outlander I decided to go to the dealership- after test driving the SE- I fell in love and the following week bought it (not NEEDING a new vehicle). I was driving a '09 Civic Si and was growing tired of a manual. The Outlander is one of the sharpest looking SUV's I've seen and the room inside is amazing. My salesman was 6'4", 240lbs and with the front seats all the way back- sitting in the back seat his knees did not touch. IMPRESSIVE!!! The price was great for everything I got including the extras. I am very pleased. Only had it for a week and immediately packed it up to go camping- exceeded my expectations.
