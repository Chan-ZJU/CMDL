2009 kia sportage
I was looking for an affordable SUV that was not a gas guzzler. The mileage is not as good as the Jeep Patriot, but for this price the Sportage is a real bargain. If your foot isn't heavy all the time, you can easily get 22-24 MPG. Kia product has dramatically improved since Hyundai bought them out.
