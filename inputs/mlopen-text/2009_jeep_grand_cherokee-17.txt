2009 jeep grand cherokee
Just bought the Overland version of the Cherokee with the Hemi. Feels like a sports car off the dime. Nice throaty roar. Love the features such as nav/multi function radio....and IPOD connection. Can upload CD or IPOD tunes to memory. Nav easy to use. Love the automatic high beam dimmer...goes to low beam when other cars appear. Very, very solid road handling...and interior very snug and comfortable. Can't wait to take this baby on a road trip. All in all...I am delighted with this vehicle so far.
