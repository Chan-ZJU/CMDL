2009 acura tsx
I bought the TSX with tech package one month ago and could not be happier with it. I traded in a 2003 BMW 325 and enjoy driving this car as much or more than the BMW. It has plenty of power for me and has a nice balance between a luxury ride and a sporty look and feel. I really love all the tech features, especially the sound system and voice-activated controls. I looked at the Lexus IS250 and BMW 328 but neither of them could compare with the price point and value of the TSX in terms of size and features. Anyone who is looking for this size and type of car in the luxury arena should give serious consideration to the TSX.
