2009 nissan gt-r
Had the car for 5 months now with 11000 km. Transmission started to make severe mechanical noise, couldn't shift from 1st to 2nd. The dealer transplanted a new transmission... I still love the car, enjoy the acceleration and cornering. If not for the transmission, it's a reliable car on every aspect. When you can beat Porsche Turbo at about 1/3 the price, I couldn't complain.
