2009 acura tl
Picked up this 2009 TL Sho With tech package 4/2009 and I must say the nav system is much better than in my 05 RL. The vehicle is fun to drive and I'm having a hard time staying out of it. The sound system is top notch and I love the IPod USB feature. Overall after doing much research and test driving BMW, Mercedes and Infinity this is the value for the money out here.
