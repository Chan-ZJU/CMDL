2009 buick enclave
After 7 years without any problems in a Highlander, I switched to the Enclave AWD. Features, past experience (I had two Buicks I drove as Federal law enforcement officer averaging 70K per year without any problems)price and 0% financing, it was a no brainer. I also did some checking on the dealer and found another Enclave owner near where I live and he had very good experience with the dealer. I have had the car now two months and still think I made the right choice. The only thing I could think of to improve would be the mileage, although it comes close to the EPA standard. As of today (June 23rd) I have a little over 2000 miles without any problems.
