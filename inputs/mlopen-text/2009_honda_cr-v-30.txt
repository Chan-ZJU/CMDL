2009 honda cr-v
I am in love with my Honda purchased 2 weeks ago. I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle compared to the 1999 Rav 4 which I traded in. Sweetheart of a ride. I feel safe and secure - it's a sound vehicle, comfortable, quiet, plenty of energy for a 4 cylinder, easy steering, decent radio, love the adjustable height in driver's seat, plus adjustable steering wheel. My first time with tinted windows - they're fantastic - no bright headlights from rear cars annoying me anymore - the window tint completely takes care of that! A bit of a problem with rear vision during backing up, also I sometimes experience a slight vibration in steering wheel at highway speeds.
