2009 ford edge
The Edge is pretty much everything advertised. It handles well and is a very "tight" vehicle. The roominess in the rear seat is definitely superior to the GM Suv's I have owned. Overall , a great vehicle with the instrument panel lighting being the only "significant " shortfall. Without any backlighting, it is hard to read on a cloudy/overcast day or towards sunset. This lack of lighting is unusual in the Industry today.
