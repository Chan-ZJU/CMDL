2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
Jumped on this after seeing 10,000 dollars off in my local market/This is a ram 1500 ST quad cab w/hemi and the 3.92 gears. First of the new coil suspension makes it ride like a couch on wheels.The engine is well super quick, i have pulled off 0-60 in under 6 seconds.Mine came with the 3.92 gears so is very capable of towing 10,000 pnds plus with ease. This truck sits higher and is wider than all other full size out there so if size an issue this may not be for you.' But for me coming out of my third Honda accord, "which i loved" it actually is more comfy but the gas well it is a big truck and i can squeeze 17 or 18 to the gallon, but hey it's a huge truck . A+ Dodge ram has a great truck!!!
