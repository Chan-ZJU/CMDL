2009 toyota avalon
I purchased the Avalon Limited edition in mid January 2009. After driving around town and on an extended trip I have to say that the Avalon is probably the smoothest driving car I have ever driven. For the size comfort and ride I am very happy. This is a great car for long trip freeway driving.
