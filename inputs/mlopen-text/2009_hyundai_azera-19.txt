2009 hyundai azera
I did the research online and with Consumer Reports. Came down the Azera or the Toyota Avalon. Drove the Avalon, nice ride but handling was way to mushy. The Azera was much tighter, lots of power. Car has every option except bluetooth. Incredible trunk space. Drove it from Colorado to my folks in Nebraska with my Wife, Daughter, SIL and Grandson. Babying it on the interstate I got 31mpg, coming home with that load and 100lbs of apples at 75mph constant I got 27mpg. I would have like more mpg, but the available power is incredible. Haven't driven anything this much fun since my 71 Firebird. The heating/AC is great, dash and instrument layout is great. 10Y/100K warranty, closed the deal.
