2009 chevrolet malibu
Purchased an LTZ with the 6 cylinder engine after testing the 4 and finding it a bit sluggish. While only in the first month of ownership, I've been delighted. The cabin is comfortable, pleasing to the eye, and very quiet. The sound system is a joy. Last night I heard low frequencies in the Saint- Saens organ concerto I'd never noticed before. The leather seats are very supportive, especially in the back-- where I appreciate the firmness. The six comes with hydraulic steering that gives just the right feedback. Mileage so far is satisfactory--19.7 mpg on short hauls around town. Glad I got the six--it has pickup that reminds me of my Dad's 65 Chrysler 300. It's eager to go.
