2009 acura tl
My TL handles so well and is one of the most comfortable rides I've had, especially upgrading from a Honda Prelude. The voice recognition for the Navi, Climate Control, and radio is awesome. It's still a bit of a learning curve though, but one of the best features. The TL has provided me with the best driving experience thus far.
