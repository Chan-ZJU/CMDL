2009 bmw 1 series
OMG! I bought my black on black 2009 BMW 135i coupe a little over a month ago and have put ~1600 miles on it to date. This is THE most fun car to drive that I have ever owned. I have owned more powerful cars, more comfortable cars and better handling (just a little!) cars but this is the first time that it has all come in the same small package. Plenty of low-end torque and horsepower, reasonable gas mileage (if I keep my foot out of it which is impossible!), comfortable on long trips and around town and absolutely gorgeous looks. I was at the racetrack recently and my car was parked next to much more expensive and exotic cars and guess which car got the most attention? The 135i!
