2009 mazda rx-8
I bought this car for my wife after her Stratus got totalled in a 7-car pile-up. All other cars we looked at were all the same. Line any brand, make or model up on a football field, and they're all the same 'boxy' car. I bought this one for her because of style, then engine, then performance. GAS MILEAGE? You've got to understand this engine. Due to its rotary nature, it all boils down to a 6- cylinder, 2-stroke engine. Typically, 2-stroke engines have never had much power until you reach a speed above city street speed, and fuel consumption matches. You can drive this car at 80 MPH in 3rd gear (yes, auto also) all day with no problems. Never slides, squeals or tilts much on turns.
