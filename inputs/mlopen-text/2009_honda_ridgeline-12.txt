2009 honda ridgeline
This is a great truck. Just be smart about what you are buying. I am really happy with my Ridge. I wanted a truck that was reliable, comfortable, and had longevity designed in - not planned obsolescence. It is not a big Ford or Chevy - it is a medium sized truck more suitable for a person who values convenience, storage, and intelligence over outright brawn. I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package. For most of us that want a truck, don't tow more than 5000 lbs, and don't live on a farm, this truck was designed with us in mind.
