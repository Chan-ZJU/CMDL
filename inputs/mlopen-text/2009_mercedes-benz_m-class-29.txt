2009 mercedes-benz m-class
Just picked up the ML for my wife. We looked at the X5, Q7 and the MDX. The ML interior is great compared to the others. The ride is fantastic! I believe that whatever issues this car had previously-they have corrected. My wife is in heaven. She loves the seats and says they are the most comfortable she has ever had. The ride is very quiet and the handling is smooth. We are very happy with our choice.
