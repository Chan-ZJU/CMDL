2009 ford focus
I've always owned GM products but decided to try a Ford. I wanted a smaller car because of getting better gas mileage. I was surprised at how stylish the 2009 Focus is. It handles great and gets good gas mileage and is very peppy for a 4 cyl. I do miss my remote start that came standard on my Malibu, the sun visors are very cheaply made, outside temp  compass should be standard on all cars.
