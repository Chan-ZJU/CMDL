2009 mitsubishi lancer
This is one sweet ride, for the price. I've had it a month  it has never let me down, even in the snow. The only option I added was Bluetooth which is something I will not live without in my next purchase. I've tested Mitsu power plants for the past 10 years, in my 97 Neon  my 98 Dodge Stratus, both engines never let me down  I have over 275000kms on the Stratus. I believe I'll get as much if not more mileage on my Lancer
