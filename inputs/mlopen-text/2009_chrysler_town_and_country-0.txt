2009 chrysler town and country
love towne and country looked long and hard at honda ans toyota vans and keep looking for two years and reading the reviews about the thier better quality but in the end feel in love with the chrysler we love the chrysler features the limited has all the bells and whisles we are still learning in town milage is 18 but on the road we are getting 24.8 in the tennesse hills ride is wonderful very quiet do not like the steering respose in curves to much steering imput but overall we love the vehicle think the reviews are to critcal and pro japenese hope we like it in 5 years and 150000 miles when we buy again love love the options
