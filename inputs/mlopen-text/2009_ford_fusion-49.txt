2009 ford fusion
Traded in a Lincoln LS for a smaller car. This unit was a surprise. More rear leg room,about same size trunk, only deeper. I'm 6' and no problem at all. Ordered without sun roof and with the heated seats. The heating and air are simply fantastic. Quiet, comfy, great on gas, roomy and great on both highway and city driving. Would not hesitate to recommend
