2009 ford f-150
I ordered this about 2 weeks ago; it is being custom built for me by Ford. The deal was amazing. Great price for a great truck. I have some upgrades from the king ranch and platinums I test drove; I am getting the dvd headrests and the dealer is obtaining a lexan roll-up bed cover, which all pickups should have. We ordered the white sand tri-coat metallic and the 20" KR wheels, navigation/Sync and moonroof. The whole thing is a luxurious work truck that does a fair job of passing as a limousine. Wonderful blend of technology, industrial design, strength, beauty and versatility. I compared this to Dodge, Chevy and Toyota. In the end, the Ford had the best combination and the best $.
