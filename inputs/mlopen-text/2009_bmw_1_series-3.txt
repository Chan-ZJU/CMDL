2009 bmw 1 series
The car is small and very fun to drive. The 128i engine has plenty of power. Very comfortable seats (sport option). The rear seats have more room that you may think, and gave to the car a great practical aspect. Trunk space also is not too bad, but it is a fun car. Inside noise, with top up or down is very low. No annoying rattles. Fuel economy: just ok. Fuel tank is small. The Ipod option works well.
