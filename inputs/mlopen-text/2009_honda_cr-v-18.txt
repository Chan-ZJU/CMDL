2009 honda cr-v
Have owned several Accords both 4 and 6 cyl. Always great performers but I now need AWD (Colorado mountains/plains) and storage room. 27/32 HWY and 22/24 urban - REALLY. Very impressed w/power and trans. in mountain and normal terrain. Big guy, it is comfortable and stability is outstanding; w/performance in windy conditions surprisingly good. Have not had any snow to test in yet. Compared with Forester (lousy 4 spd trans.) almost went w/it anyway, Rav4 (not as stable and the swing out rear door is dangerous) and Edge (lousy mpg but felt substantial).
