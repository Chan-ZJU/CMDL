2009 mercedes-benz c-class
I picked my C350W at the Sindelfingen factory as part of the European Delivery Alps/Black Forest rally trip. The level of comfort, quiet, and road performance is simply outstanding. As an engineer I really appreciate all of the hidden details and overall sophistication in the design features. I have driven stretches of autobahn at 110 MPH and the car is serenely quiet and rock solid at this speed. This is combined with strong brakes, effortless tracking on winding country roads, and unexpectdly good mileage on this trip 24.9 MPG overall. Firm seating comfortable for long stretches, awesome HK Logic 7 sound system, smart HID lights, and great instrumentation and controls.
