2009 toyota highlander
It's new. Rides great. Maneuvers well. Plenty of get up and go. Has all the bells and whistles. Fit and trim are excellent. First non-"big three" we have owned. Center dash w/navigation/CD combined is too delicate and complex. Steering wheel controls good/dash controls unnecessarily confusing. Owners Manual near useless - WAY TOO LONG. More comfortable than competitors especially for someone over 6'2" and 250 lbs. Cargo area is good w/3rd seat down.
