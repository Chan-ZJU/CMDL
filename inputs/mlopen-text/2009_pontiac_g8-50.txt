2009 pontiac g8
I bought this vehicle the end of July 08. Always thought I wanted a Charger. After test driving both I found I prefer the G8. It has more power than I'll ever need and very comfortable seating. My teens vibrate the whole car with their music, but otherwise the sound system in great. And I found it affordable.
