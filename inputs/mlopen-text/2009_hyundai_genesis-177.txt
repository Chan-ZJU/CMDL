2009 hyundai genesis
So today I went to Power Hyundai in Scottsdale AZ for my first service. My NAV/Radio were fine. They tried to apply the T63 update and after three tries quit because the second DVD of 3 was rejected. The technicians called Hyundai tech support all day and got no response from the tech people. My radio is OK but NAV stopped working and all works Verrrrry slooooowly. They promise to get this fixed. My beef is with Hyundai tech support. What right do they have not to call back all day to a dealership needing help? I called the consumer line and was told by the only person I could reach that he would call a regional manager- obviously a useless ploy. Hyundai needs to get organized/return calls!!
