2009 nissan maxima
Wow, what a great car. Just got an 09 with sports package, truly lust at first drive. Incredible power, throaty exhaust note, handles/corners well. Eye catching styling. Comfy seats hug and support. Well designed cockpit, easy to see gauges and controls. Having a lot of fun with this one.
