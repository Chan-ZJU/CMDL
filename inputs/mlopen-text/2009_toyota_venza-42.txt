2009 toyota venza
This is a vehicle whose time has come. It is exactly what I was looking for in 01 when I bought my Highlander. It is loaded with all the latest Toyota features and has all the utility of an SUV without the SUV downsides. If my test drive was any indication, I'm going to really enjoy this vehicle. The fit and finish are superior (what we used to expect from Toyota). And it comes without the hefty price tag of the new SUVs.
