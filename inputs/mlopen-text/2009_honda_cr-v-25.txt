2009 honda cr-v
This car is great. with the AWD I don't have to choose when to put it into 4 wheel drive. I love the safety features. Having a baby I feel more comfortable with the side airbags. I love the room in the back with the stroller and at least 5 medium suitcases being able to fit as well. Best car ever! I would suggest it to anyone.
