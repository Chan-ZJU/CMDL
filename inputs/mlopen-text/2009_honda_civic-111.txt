2009 honda civic
Turned in a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan with 230000 miles in the CARS program and couldn't be happier. This car looks and feels fantastic. Could have a little more zip when merging on the highway, but it is certainly not a dog and it cruises in the mid 70's (mph) seamlessly. Absolutely comfortable and hugs the road. Nice interior design and two tier instrument panel is beautiful and ergonomic. Sound system is excellent.
