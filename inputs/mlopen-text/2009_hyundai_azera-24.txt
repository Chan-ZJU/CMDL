2009 hyundai azera
Have you ever been outside on a hot July summer night. The street is warm, and the wind is at a stand-still. Then all of the sudden a car whisp by and you don't even see it. That is what happpens when the new Hyundai azera comes through. People don't know what happened. The design is one of a kind. It has a 3.8 liter, or 3.3 liter. Enough hp's to throw your head back. The leather is smooth. Really if it had a Honda or Toyota tag, the dealership could not get enough models in stock. So I recommend this car. You shoul go drive drive.
