2009 volkswagen tiguan
Purchased two weeks ago and have been very happy with the quality and features of the SEL package. It stands out from the competitors with its exterior and interior design. Get many comments about it whenever we are out in it. Drives and rides very good plus the 2.0 gives good acceleration when merging on the highway. The roof was not on the wish list but is a nice feature. Spent hours researching all the other competitors models and felt this Tiguan stood out. So far only one gas fill up and was mainly city driving, gas mileage to be determined. The build quality seems to be very tight, the heated seats are very comfortable, it drives great and has excellent power. So far a great buy.
