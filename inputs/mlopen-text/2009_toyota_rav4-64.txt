2009 toyota rav4
I decided give a try for RAV4 after good experience with my wife Siena08. 2009 RAV4 is very roomy and I bought a full load Limited. My previous experience was a much heavier LR Discovery V8, and RAV4 performer better, thanks to light body and very well designed transmission. The interior everything are very well resolved, but the material looks cheaper, even leather trim is not first class. There are excessive noise in cabin, combined from engine and road. Update, combined millage is 21mpg, not bad for a I-4 AWD, but I don't think I'll get promised 27mpg freeway.
