2009 ford focus
I love this car! The way this car looks in black is stunning. The wheels are dark chrome, the front grill is dark chrome, even the front and back lights have a dark chrome look to them. I may be biased towards that color but it looks much better then any other color offered. The interior is pretty good for a sub-compact. SYNC is very easy to use and to set up. Cloth bucket seats are comfortable. The car turns on a dime and is very nimble, even in reverse with the pedal to the floor. The ice blue dash looks incredible at night with the ambient lighting set to Purple. The standard sound system sounds better then I expected. The trunk is HUGE. You could probably fit grown 3 teenagers inside.
