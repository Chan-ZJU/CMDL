2009 ford focus
first let me begin by stating i beat and tear at this car constantly and it's a great all around car, i've had it for about a year and been in one accident and it runs like brand new still. although the trunk may be annoying at times because it is not bolted down but that's probubly its only fault, personally i have two dual JBL subwoofers in my trunk and they sounds great in the focus... all around outstanding quality.
