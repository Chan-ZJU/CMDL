2009 bmw 5 series
Driven the car for just under 3,000 miles and it's fantastic so far. Heated seats and steering wheel combined with X-Drive have been excellent during this active New England winter. Best driving car I've ever owned, and interior annoyances (lack of storage space, cup holders) are acceptable given the driving dynamics, all-weather aplomb and overall content of the car.
