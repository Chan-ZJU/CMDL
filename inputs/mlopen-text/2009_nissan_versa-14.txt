2009 nissan versa
This is a great car. Classified as a sub-compact but feels much bigger. More front seat room than my friend's prius. (I am a big person.) sits high which makes it easy to get in and out of. First tank's mileage=27 mpg in mixed driving, including a Major multi-mile summer beach traffic jam.
