2009 chevrolet traverse
Lots of good features, but safety and reliability are my main concern, so when I discovered that my brand new traverse, not an inexpensive vehicle, does not include a spare tire, a donut or even a place to attach one, I was shocked. It doesn't really matter that onstar can send help if you have a flat.. If you have no tire, and have to towed, what are the occupants of this 7 passenger vehicle to do? wait by the side of the road? taxi's are often not available in rural areas. For this kind of money, I am just appalled that gm would even produce a vehicle without BASIC family saftey items such as a spare tire. Moms, families, beware of the danger of being stranded at all times.
