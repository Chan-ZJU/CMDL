2009 mazda mazda6
Moved up from a Mazda3, and am very impressed with how smooth and quiet the car is. Exterior styling is edgy without being too trendy and should hold up well over the years. Interior styling is simple and elegant, and mostly very high quality (but what's up with the thin vinyl on the armrest and the Buick velour on the door panels??). On a 500 mile trip I averaged 34mpg in mostly rural driving at 60-65mph with a good bit of stop- and-go intown driving, and have been averaging about 27mpg around town. Pretty awesome for such a big car. I love that the car looks big, but drives like a much smaller car. The ride is firm, but very compliant, a near perfect balance of handling and ride comfort.
