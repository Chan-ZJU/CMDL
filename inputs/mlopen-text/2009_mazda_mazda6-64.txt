2009 mazda mazda6
I put off buying a new mid-size sedan for a couple of months as I knew the '09 Mazda6 was coming in August. The wait was 100% worth it. It's the best looking car in its class without question. The interior is easily a full class ahead of the Camry, Accord, Altima, or Malibu. As with most Mazdas, the handling is excellent making it a pure joy to drive. I can't imagine anyone test driving all the mid-size sedans out there and not picking the 6. The features/fit/finish etc are closer to a Lexus ES350 than a Camry. This car is going to own the magazine mid-size comparison tests for at least 2-3 years.
