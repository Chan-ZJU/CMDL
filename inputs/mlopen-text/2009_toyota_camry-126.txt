2009 toyota camry
We bought our SE because we thought it would look cool in black with the sport body kit, but there are so many Camrys, they're everywhere. They always looked bad exterior wise, but I thought the reliability was worth it. After 7 months, I ran out the warranty (I drive a lot for work) and the car had electronic problems from the first week. The interior has been falling apart from day one when the door panel came off. I have to go to the shop once every two months because the engine makes odd noises. The interior is, unimaginative to say the least, it truly is an appliance vehicle, no style.
