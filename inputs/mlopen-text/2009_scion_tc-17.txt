2009 scion tc
I bought this car 3 days ago and I LOVE it! I was actually looking at pontiac g5's and Chevy Malibus before being dragged to look at Toyotas by my parents. I didn't really like anything I saw until I saw the Scion. I am not a fan of hatchbacks or small cars at all, but after test driving it and all the features it had just as a stock car I was impressed. It has a lot of torque for such a small car and is so much fun to drive. It doesn't even look like the ugly boxy cars I pictured as Scions.
