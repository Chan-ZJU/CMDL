2009 dodge caliber
I purchased after test driving the Scion XD, Nissan versa, Nissan Cube, KIA Soul, Chevrolet HHR. The Caliber is a far more substantial car, not "tiny" feeling at all. I got the 1.8 engine with the 5 speed manual transmission. What an outstanding combination. The car feels wonderful, corners really flat with great handling. Just took it out yesterday to the coast on a really windy hilly road. Great passing ability, pulls up just fine on hills. (Also 35+ MPG). It hit 111 yesterday, the AC works just great no problem at all keeping up with that heat on next to the lowest setting on the AC.
