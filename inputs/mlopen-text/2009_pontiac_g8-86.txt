2009 pontiac g8
Posted earlier, loved it then, love it now. Very disappointed that Pontiac will be going away. Buy one of these cars if a car for you is not just a means of transportation. It is a blast to drive, even in V-6 form. I got the upgraded interior and 6 disc CD player. I have received as many compliments about this car as my 2000 Corvette, maybe more.
