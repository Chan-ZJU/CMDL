Love and Saint Augustine
Editors Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott and Judith Chelius Stark make Hannah Arendt's important early work accessible for the first time. Here is a completely corrected and revised English translation that incorporates Arendt's own substantial revisions and provides additional notes based on letters, contracts, and other documents. A revelation that may force us to reconsider the traditional interpretation of Arendt's work.--KIRKUS REVIEWS.
