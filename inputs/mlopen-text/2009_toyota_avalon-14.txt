2009 toyota avalon
This is my third Avalon. I am still getting used to it but overall, I really like it. It has a great ride and is very quiet. The only thing I do not like is the hardness of the drivers seat. I can feel something under the padding, perhaps it has something to do with the seat's cooling feature. I have been driving around for the last 4 months with a thin quilt under me. This makes it more comfortable. Hopefully the seats will break in and I can take out the quilt. Other than that, I really love it.
