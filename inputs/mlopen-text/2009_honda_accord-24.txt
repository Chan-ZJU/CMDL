2009 honda accord
Bought 09 Accord EX V6 (cloth) in April. It was a replacement of my 2004 V6 Toyota Camry after total. Accord is a bigger car, which I don't necessarily like, but I did not want another Camry and was unsure about Malibu due to the situation with GM. I like the performance and comfort of the car. No problem with seats. There is definitely much more noise than was in the Camry, some say this is because of tires, some say it is due to glass. MPG is average - seems like my previous Toyota was better. VCM is annoying with downshifting and slowing down. I do not know if it really improves MPG - I shift to neutral downhill and it runs faster. ECO light is annoying and distracts attention.
