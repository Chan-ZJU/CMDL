2009 pontiac g6
I have had this car for 4 months now and am very happy. The car rides exceptionally well, is fun to drive, and smooth on the freeway. The 4-cyl engine is adequate for my needs and gets fairly good gas mileage. I love the sunroof and the car looks great with the rear spoiler. This is my first car with Onstar and the navigation turn by turn directions are very convenient, especially when looking for a particular restaurant around town. Overall, this car has great value and I'm pleased with my purchase.
