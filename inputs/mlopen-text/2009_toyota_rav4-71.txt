2009 toyota rav4
Why 'My Little Rocket'? My Rav4 accelerates, handles,  performs very smoothly. After over 20 years of driving the entire range of only Ford SUVs, I made the decision to go Toyota, which I believe was a wise one. I just wish I did it years ago. Going from an '05 Escape 6 cyl AWD to the '09 Rav4 4 cyl AWD, I expected sluggishness, but instead found it peppier with all-around better handling  performance in  on the VT snow  variable roads conditions. Having to drive over 2.5 hours, several times per week to VT, I find the drivers side lumbar support  heated seats a godsend. Gas mileage falls within the stated 21 to 27 mpg, with 24 mpg as my average. It should improve over time.
