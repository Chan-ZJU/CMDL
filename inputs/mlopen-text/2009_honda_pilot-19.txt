2009 honda pilot
This 2009 Honda Pilot has been a real disappointment. With approx. 5200 miles since new in August 2008 we are not pleased with the over all quality. At less than 1000 miles the rear windshield wiper assembly flew off when I turned it on. The battery has died twice while parked with everything off. This happened at approx 3200 miles and just this week with 5000 miles. The side trim panel on the drivers side door next to the window fell off. The entire vehicle rattles and squeaks as if there were 105,000 miles on it (Our 02 SAAB  03 VW are quiet!) The right front passenger seat is jerky when you use the forward-back adjustment. The shift lever make operating or tuning the radio uncomfortable.
