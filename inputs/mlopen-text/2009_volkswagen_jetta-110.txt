2009 volkswagen jetta
Bought 2009 Jetta TDI. At 720 miles had a severe problem with the transmission. In park, with engine running shifted into reverse...trans acted like it was in neutral engine raced, shift indicator lights started blinking, depress brake pedal before starting light came on, and car went into reverse and lurched backwards almost hitting other car...next nite,10pm 50 miles per hour, engine goes into neutral even with gear in drive, gear light blinking brake pedal light on simultaneously.just like ex. above. Almost got rear ended. had car for less than week...now told need a transmission tear down and evaluation of all sensors. I want my car replaced with a new one!!!
