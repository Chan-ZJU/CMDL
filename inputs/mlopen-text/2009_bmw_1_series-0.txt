2009 bmw 1 series
First BMW I owned. Was hesitant at first because of reliability issues but so far have had no problems. Gas mileage in the city is poor (avg. about 15 mpg), but gas mileage on the highway is great (avg. 31 mpg). I have the sports package with 18 inch wheels so the handling is fantastic. The car is so fun to drive and I love the small size of the car. Why are new cars so large these days? Used to own a TSX (good car too) but this car is so much more fun. Also, The RFT tires don't really bother me at all. Overall, best car I have owned.
