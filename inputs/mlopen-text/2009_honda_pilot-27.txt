2009 honda pilot
Thought I would contribute a review to try to assist others with the agonizing decision I made - one that I am very happy I made: to go with a 2009 Honda Pilot 4wd Touring over the Highlander, Xterra and Pathfinder, and CX-9. Many object to the looks of the Pilot - we like it lot; looks like a real SUV. This vehicle is the clear choice for those looking for the utmost utility, safety, modern conveniences, and medium- duty off-road capability (yes, that is what the Pilot's chassis, unibody structural integrity, and suspension are designed for), reasonable fuel efficiency, and highly functional (hopefully reliable) 4WD system. Pilot=best value/content going for the $$$ - mighty beefy S/CUV!
