2009 acura tsx
I changed my mind a day before to purchase an 09 Accord EXL V6. I made a great deal on both vehicles. I only had to pay 1000 more to get a TSX. The new V6 Accord engine is new in the market with the 3/4/6 cylinder running mode. Didn't like that. Didn't know the TSX is in my price range. TSX was quieter than Accord. Better suspension, better material (leather), comes with HID, and better interior. With only $1000 difference I'm going for the TSX. The engine is slightly noisier than my 08 TL, but 4 cyl. is expected to do that.
