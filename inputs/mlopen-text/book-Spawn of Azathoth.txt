Astronomers have theorized that our sun is not alone in its journey areound the galaxy, but is accompanied by an unknown second star of dim radiance. This second star, while perhaps invisible from Earth even with the finest optics, would periodically pass close enough to our solar system to have far-reaching effects upon the evolution of this planet.
