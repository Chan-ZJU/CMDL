2009 mitsubishi lancer
I bought my car just over a year ago and I have no complaints about it. I hear some that say it doesn't live up to the fuel economics, but I drove from San Diego to Washington averaging 31 mpg. If that's not good enough for you then buy a prius. Car has been great and everything that I bought it for. Fun to drive and decent power for how much it weighs. Wish I would have waited for the Ralliart.
