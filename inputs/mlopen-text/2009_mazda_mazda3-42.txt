2009 mazda mazda3
Just bought it. Already put fifty miles on it. I got the manual because it gets better mpg than the auto. I narrowed it down to a Malibu and a Corolla Sport and for the money this is a much better car. I test drove a loaded Corolla Sport and figured the Mazda3 was going to be too small for me but I was wrong and it is a blast to drive! I got the six speaker six CD disc that would cost an extra grand with the Corolla and this car has ABS and traction control. I recommend this car to anyone.
