2009 toyota camry
Only 1700 miles so far but had to speak up. I love this car! 25+ mpg daily on 50-mile mixed commute. Great seats front and back even for two people with chronic back problems. Quiet, almost soothing ride. Precise and responsive handling. V-6 gives immediate, smooth power when needed and can really fly! Driving position like a cockpit, nice for those used to a smaller car. Passengers love individually reclining back seats and pulldown sun shade. Compare stats - back seat space is huge versus most sedans thanks to extra legroom. Tight build, no rattles, flaws or gaps. Car's design is elegant and stylish. Build quality and ride better than Cadillac. My first Toyota and I'm impressed.
