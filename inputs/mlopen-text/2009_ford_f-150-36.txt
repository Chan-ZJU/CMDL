2009 ford f-150
I have owned many vehicles over many years, including many trucks. This new Platinum series F150 is definitely one of the best. Incredibly quiet, comfortable and well built. The new 6 speed automatic with tow/haul works very well. Fuel mileage is on par with what you would expect for a vehicle of this weight and size, but I actually find it to be better than many in this category. This truck is so good, even some of my Chevy truck friends are looking at Ford! The combination of comfort and utility, with 11,100 lbs of towing and high load capacity is unbeatable. Kudos to Ford and Ocala Ford dealer for a superior product!
