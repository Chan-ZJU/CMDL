2009 chevrolet traverse
 After my purchase I drove the Traverse on a 2,000 mile trip to Washington state via the Calif. coast highway. The Traverse averaged almost 19 M.P.G. highway and almost 13 M.P.G. around town ! This mileage has remained the same after almost 5000 miles on the vehicle and my Chevrolet dealer says that all is fine and all is NORMAL ! The mileage is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E and what is worse,I can't do anything about it. I continue to pay for a fuel efficient vehicle and ,in reality, can't afford to drive this GAS GUZZLER. Chevrolet is somewhat less than honest with their mileage estimates ! I wish Chevy had this vehicle back and I had a REAL car ! Chevy's ads should be illegal !
