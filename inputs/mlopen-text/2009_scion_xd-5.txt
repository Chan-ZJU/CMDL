2009 scion xd
I've had this car for a year now, bought no extras except the pioneer radio. I had wanted to stick with Honda, but their options were limited. This ended up being the whole package for me ... looks nice, fun to drive, and great for growing into when we start our family. I was extremely surprised by it's pep and how roomy it was inside. Best of all, it gets WAY better MPG than sticker shows ... I get between 33 and 37 mpg Hwy depending on how I drive (and 75mph is my minimum). I've had 3 Hondas previously and wanted to another, but this car beat out anything Honda had to offer in my book!
