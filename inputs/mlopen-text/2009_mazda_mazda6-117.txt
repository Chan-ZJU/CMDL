2009 mazda mazda6
I still love my Mazda6, but I have to downgrade the build quality(interior only) just a bit as I've found now, a total of three "fit and finish" issues, all three being on the driver's side(maybe the result of a disgruntled, or "could care less" assembler on that side),e.g., small cover over speaker attached on one corner only, control switch panel "cover" on driver's door bowed slightly in middle, preventing a flush fit, and a 1/2 inch gap between plastic fits near console...None of these things are terribly important, but irritating. There isn't a single issue or problem on the passenger side. The car is still great fun to drive, and everything else about my previous review holds.
