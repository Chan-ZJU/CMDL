2009 subaru forester
Have been driving this vehicle for about 3 months and have all the options except navigation and have been satisfied with the drive I had on local and highway. Decent MPG about 25 on an average. The SRS audio doesn't seem to work as expected no help from the dealer as well. Haven't experienced any rattling as some complained. Nice to drive and good control on the road. Overall a Satisfied Subaru Forester patron.
