2009 pontiac vibe
I had been researching new models (Honda Fit, Yaris, and Versa) when the 09 came out. Was pretty much set on a Nissan Versa. The Vibe was only about $2000 more than the Versa comparably equipped. With the added features not available on the Versa (ABS, disc brakes all around, stability control, traction control, XM radio, On Star, and hands free phone) it made the Vibe a very nice upgrade. I now have 1300 miles on it, and have averaged 32.6 mpg 50-50 hwy/cty. The 5-speed is very smooth and nicely placed high on the floor. Ride is great; performance is more than adequate while delivering excellent gas mileage. Really a nice car.
