2009 nissan altima
Just picked it up yesterday after years of waiting and researching (thank you Edmunds!) 2.5S with Convenience Package and Moonroof in Winter Frost. I'm 6' 2" so I have the seat back/down, which does create some blind spots. Ride is quiet and the CVT is great. Push-button start and keyless entry are pretty neat.
