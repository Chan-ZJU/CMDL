2009 acura tsx
I bought this vehicle three months ago and still I'm in love with it. It's steering and turn radius is great. It's sleek and sexy looking with a sporty feel. It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan, but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident. The interior is very stylish and although the buttons/navigation system can seem intimidating, it's not difficult to understand how to use it.
