2009 acura tsx
I had been looking for a car for several months. When the new body style was released I fell in love. I use my vehicle to drive to and from work and school. She (my TSX) has taken good care of me. I look forward to getting in my vehicle every morning, traffic or not she is amazingly comfortable.
