2009 ford fusion
I have always enjoyed looking at the Fusion, mainly the SEL models. Now that Ford has slapped the sport appearance package on the SE its a sweet ride. I traded my 08 Tribute 2.3L for a 2.3L SE. What a difference with the same engine and a 5 speed auto makes. This car is so loaded and the rebates made it a no-brainer. I had X plan and a $3500 rebate. I bought a $23500 car for $17800. Vapor silver is so sleek looking with the 18" wheels. Mileage should be a better than 26mpg on my tribute. All my friends love the aggressive look. Honda, Toyota, Nissan and even the new Mazda6 just can't compare. Interested to see what the refreshened Fusion looks like, but the deals wont be as good!
