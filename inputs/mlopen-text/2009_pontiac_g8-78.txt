2009 pontiac g8
I love being able to roll up next to someone driving an Acura or Infiniti or BMW 3/5 series and then smoke them off the line. They had no idea. I've not had one problem with the car. The best experience is driving this car around town and everyone looking at it because you don't see these cars everyday.. And the ride is very comfortable.
