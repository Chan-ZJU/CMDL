2009 volkswagen jetta
Terrible problems with the transmission...shifted from park to reverse...depress brake pedal light came on, and gear indicator light (prnds) started flashing and car slipped into neutral, but re- engaged...lurched backward and almost hit pasng car...then next night...driving 50 mph in drive...car jumped to neutral, engine raced to redline... gear shift indicator light started flashing and depress brake pedal light before starting light came on...almost got rear-ended by car behind me. Dealer said i have to have transmission torn apart and some type of sensor replaced...done research...found this problem exists, along with flywheel and mechatronic module...sent report to NHTSA...
