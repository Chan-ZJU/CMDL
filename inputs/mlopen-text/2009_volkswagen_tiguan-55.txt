2009 volkswagen tiguan
I was researching the market for several months and nothing really convinced me until I came across the Tiguan. I have one for about two months now and I'm loving every minute of it! It is fun to drive, the engine is wonderful, a lot of small features that make this the perfect car. Plus it has the highest possible safety rating and it looks just amazing. Fuel economy is actually better than advertised, 20/27.
