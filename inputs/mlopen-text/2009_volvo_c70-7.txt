2009 volvo c70
I am a loyal Volvo customer and have owned a Volvo since 2001. My latest purchase exceeds my expectation. The car has a well thought out design both inside and out. The "tranformer" like hardtop puts on a fun show. My car is smooth as silk. And the bass on the audio is awesome. The turbo has a nice punch and you can pick up speed pretty well, but I don't think I will be drag racing this car. The room in this car for a convertible is surprising and even my over 6ft men in my life have leg room. The safety features that Volvo has included along with that smooth ride makes you feel safe and secure even with the top down.
