2009 hyundai elantra touring
Although we only have a couple of hundred miles on it so far, I've driven many cars over the years and feel I am qualified to offer my thoughts on this car. While many wish for more HP, I feel it is satisfactory for what the car is designed to do, get you from point A-B as economically as possible with as much comfort as possible. This car achieves these goals. The steering is certainly lacking that "Hug the road" feel. The brakes work well with plenty of stopping power. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck. The best thing is that the S.O. loves it and when she's happy, the world is happy! Safe Travels.
