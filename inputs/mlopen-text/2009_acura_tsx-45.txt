2009 acura tsx
I have been driving my new TSX for a week now and love it. Acura did a great job of making the most popular features standard (Xenon, Bluetooth, etc). The car has more than adequate pickup and handles very well. It also has a nice back seat. We test drove the IS 250, A4, G35, and S60/60. The TSX has the best combo of space, size, features, and performance of the group. The TSX's motor is superior to that of the IS 250 and A4 IMO. It has similar real world performance capabilities and gets better mileage. It is a very refined little car. Perfect for us. The IS and A4 were too small in the back seat and don't match the MPG--I am getting 29.7.
