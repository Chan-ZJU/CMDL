2009 acura tsx
I've been driving my TSX for a month now and I like it a lot except for the ride quality. The suspension is way too stiff and the ride is jittery on any surface (as noted in Consumer Report). I'm told that it will soften with time. I hope so. The 5.1 sound system is outstanding. I don't have a problem with the nav screen because I'm short but I can see that if I was several inches higher in the seat, I would see the reflection of the windows in the nav screen. Not good. Excellent build quality overall and no problem whatsoever so far. I'll report again later in the year.
