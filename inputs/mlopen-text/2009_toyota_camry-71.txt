2009 toyota camry
I love the Camry. I live in southern Virginia and travel to Pittsburgh, my hometown, several times a year. The trip is about 8 hours and I don't feel the least bit tired after the drive. It's comfortable, has great handling, and looks good too. Every time I stop along the trip, folks compliment me on it being such a good looking car. Toyota is such a reliable car, so I'm happy I made this purchase from domestic cars to a Toyota. The domestics don't hold a candle to the Camry.
