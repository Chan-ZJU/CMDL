2009 honda accord
The seats in my 2009 Accord are so incredibly uncomfortable that I can't continue to drive this vehicle. Even though I will lose money I will have to sell this vehicle. The Honda engineers really missed the mark in this regard. In the past I have owned a 1985 Accord, a 1990 Accord, a 1995 Civic, and a 1998 Accord the seats in these years and models were quite comfortable. Have been told by Honda of America that the Honda engineers decided to redesign the seats and I should have gone for a longer test drive. Needles to say this once faithful Honda customer will no longer be buying and driving Hondas.
