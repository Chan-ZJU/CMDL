2009 volkswagen passat
This is our third Passat having bought a new 1997 diesel and 2004 diesel. We love the diesels but gave up on VW ever getting the Passat diesel into North America. VW always seems to be three steps behind the marketing curve. We are quite pleased with our 2009, even though it isn't a diesel and we certainly miss that mileage. It handles beautifully but is noisier than our 2004 due to the low profile tires. We bought new tires and went one size up and the noise decreased. Our big gripe is that VW dropped Homelink from the Passat but not the Passat CC. Another braindead action by VW. Their response to my inquiry: "Our marketing plan for North America does not include the diesel or Homelink."
