2009 toyota venza
Purchased a black loaded 2wd Venza. Pretty much everything is on it. Extremely nice to drive. Replaced a 2007 Camry V6 Limited. Navigation is much improved. JBL stereo is also much better then previous model. Handles pretty well for a tall vehicle, Automatic high beams is kind of unusual, takes some getting used to. So far we both love it.
