2009 mazda mazda6
The all new 6 is a very attractive car and for the price its loaded with features compared to Accord and Camry. It sporty than even the Altima with a smoother nicer ride than that car but not as smooth as Camry. Two issues I had. One after test driving there was a strong burning plastic smell. Not the typical "break in" smell you have with new cars.
