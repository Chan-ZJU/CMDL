2009 chevrolet silverado 1500
Bought in Feb 09. With 29 miles on it, it started having extended start problems. After 4 months and 5 trips to repair, they finally realized the fuel injectors were leaking and replaced all eight; seemed to fix the problem. Other than that very nice truck. Could be a little plusher inside and provide more storage, particularly in the rear seat area. Drives as good or better than my 09 Honda Pilot. Fuel economy not great, but hoping to improve. The brakes squeal quite a bit, but only after sitting for a day or two.
