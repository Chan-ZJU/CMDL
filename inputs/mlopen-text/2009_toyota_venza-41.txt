2009 toyota venza
We picked up our new Venza yesterday, 3.5 V-6, AWD, leather, nav, tow pkg - all options except rear DVD. Very impressive vehicle, outstanding build quality inside and out, solid handling and cornering, fast (0-60 in 6.8 sec) excellent ride, reasonable mileage as near as we can determine, but it's a bit early for numbers. The nav and audio are a lot more user friendly and better integrated than the system in our '05 Odyssey. The floor is flat for easy entry/exit and the rocker panels are totally covered by the doors. Clever touch, especially for the gals, keeps your clothes clean in rainy conditions. Dual moon roof adds a large rear non-opening panel. A crossover-wagon mix, excellent.
