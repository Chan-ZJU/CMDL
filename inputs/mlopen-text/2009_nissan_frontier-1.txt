2009 nissan frontier
Been Toyota Tacoma driver for 14 years. Frontier seems ok so far. Rides a little ruff, think it's going to be a rattling truck. Hearing some noises already, bought on 7/31. Stereo is very nice so w/volume up can't hear noises. 4cy automatic doesn't do too well w/cruise on. Like roominess cab, love access doors. Bigger than my 1995 Tacoma so I'm getting used to tighter turning radius. Did cash for clunker  couldn't get Toyota. If I had do overs I might would have taken my chances on waiting to get Tacoma, that was my 1st choice. Just not sure it's going to last me 14 years like last truck. On this review, I'm not sure I chose the right style. It's 4Cy, king cab, power package, full bed
