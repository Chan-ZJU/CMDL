2009 pontiac vibe
I love my 2006 Vibe and purchased it due to the reliability in northern snow, gas mileage  the height of the seating, head room and the ability of additional load capacity when the back seats are down. I also love the side covers that protect the bottom of the doors and around the tires where road rocks put pings on most autos and hurt the paint. Your new 2009 Vibe has changed most of the good features by lowering the height of the auto, making it less apt to maneuver in deep snow. Lowered the angle of the windshield at a loss of head room and removed the protective side panels so the new 2009 would look sportier.
