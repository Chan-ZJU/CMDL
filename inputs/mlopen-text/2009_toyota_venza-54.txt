2009 toyota venza
We traded a 2008 Accord for this Venza, much less road noise than the Honda. The front seat comfort is excellent. We get the same gas mileage in a 4 cylinder as we did in the Accord. First two trips on a fresh engine got us 28.8, so its right on the 29 sticker. Plus no more brake problems like all late model Accords. Love the comfort and room. The back seat is one of the most comfortable of any I have ever sat in. 4 cylinder has plenty of power and the V6 is just plain fast for a family size car. Plus, it just looks great. Very modern and stylish. Would recommend to anyone.
