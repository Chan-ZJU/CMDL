2009 pontiac g8
I just bought a 2009 G8 GT, Stryker blue. The color was chosen by my wife, I wanted Panther black but I am getting used to it! The car rides very well in comparison to my 2004 GTO. The ride is firm but not as harsh as the GTO. I have not really pushed the G8 yet but I expect great performance. Fit and finish are very good. My wife has received many compliments on the car's appearance. It has sleek and muscular lines. Difficult to combine but the G8 has them. I looked at the new CTS but the G8 offered a V8, Cadillac didn't, plus, at a lower price point ($10K). I looked at several imports, but I have bought American for over 25 years. Congratulations to GM for importing this fine car.
