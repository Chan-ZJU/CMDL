2009 pontiac g8
I have been a GM customer for years, owning a number of cars that were primarily just for transportation. The exception was my 1984 Buick Regal T Type (same as the Grand National, only in blue with chrome bumpers). I contemplated the G8 GT for quite some time I and finally purchased the same day that I helped my son buy a new Sierra. With all the GM incentives and my GM card points, I got the 34K car for 25k; how could I go wrong? Even the dealer said I could probably sell it for more than I paid. I think the styling, especially from a distance, is fantastic and the interior is beautiful; so the leather isn't on the doors, who cares? For a large 4 door sedan, it is impossible to beat.
