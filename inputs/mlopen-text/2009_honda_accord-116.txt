2009 honda accord
Fortunately the sound system is decent, as it helps to drown out all the road and wind noise. What happened to the sound deadening on this car? Depending on road surface, it can be hard to carry on a conversation. Despite the fussy- looking dash and console, all controls work well. Ride and handling are sound, and the 4-cylinder is more than adequate while delivering decent mileage. Purchased on Honda name and reputation, but overall this car has been a bit of a letdown.
