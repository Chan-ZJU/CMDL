2009 honda pilot
We've been happy with our Pilot. We're hooked on the XM radio, love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior. We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch, but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is $181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper(?!). Even more disappointed that the connector under the bumper is a goofy connector that NOBODY carries yet. Happy over all though. We'll just wait to buy a harness from someone not trying to rip off a customer for an overpriced set of wires. Happy with the handling, but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed
