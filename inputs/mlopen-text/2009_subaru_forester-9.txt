2009 subaru forester
This is my 6th Subaru, but in between I've owned Toyotas and Chevys. Before Subaru I've owned just about all makes of mid-priced cars. This Forester (my 4th) has great styling, a comfortable well put together interior, and best of all, full time AWD. Once you own a Subaru you always wonder why you'd buy anything else. The cars starts easily, drives flawlessly and is greatly admired by people at work and on the street. A black Forester with black leather and dark tinted windows is one classy ride. Storage room is great, the stereo system is clear and easy to use and the huge sunroof is a pleasure. One thing I do know... all future cars for me will start with the word Subaru!
