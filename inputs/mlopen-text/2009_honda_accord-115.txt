2009 honda accord
Fun to drive 6 speed manual, Great features for the price. Decent MPG and excellent performance. Leather seats are poor quality, and wear badly. Only other disappointment is with the TPMS not working with snow tires after paying up for the sensors. Would love to have the EV-L options without the leather. Exterior looks are very nice. Really enjoy the car. Dash controls are a bit overly complicated. Car feels like a Honda, it will run a long time with no major repairs. Honda did miss their standard of quality with the leather seats.
