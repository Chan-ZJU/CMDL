2009 mazda mazda5
Drives great, has sufficient power for everyday driving, quiet ride and no engine noise, versatile seating with many options. Japanese built with Japanese parts, nice stereo and it comes fully loaded with all the features I needed. Sliding doors are a blessing with four year old twins. Alloy wheels with low profile tires look sharp. Looks very attractive inside and out. For a purchase price of $16,888 I can't be any happier or satisfied.
