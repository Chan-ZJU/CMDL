2009 jeep patriot
My wife was in a high speed collision totaling our 07' Patriot. She was banged up but I was very surprised how well this little truck absorbed the impact. Since she lived and we had no complaints with the 07' we bought an 09'. The 09' interior is that of a normal car, the 07 (and 08) have an uncomfortable rock hard interior and very little storage room. For anyone who dislikes the cvt when braking, simply leave your foot barely on the gas and it won't bog down like that. It's a small price to pay for the amount of power you gain from always being in the power band with the cvt in addition to having great fuel mileage along with that power.
