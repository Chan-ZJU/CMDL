2009 nissan maxima
My wife and I just purchased the 3.5 SV premium fully loaded. The looks of this car are great inside and out. The engine and transmission are second to none for its class and there are enough gadgets on the car to make any ?gadget freak? blush. There are 2 modes for driving: an automatic mode or an ?aggressive? manual mode which we found impressive. We test drove the Infinity M35 AWD prior to our purchase and the Maxima gave it a run for its money; in some instances beating it. The car is roomy and comfortable, however if you?re a person over 6? tall, I recommend not sitting in the back seat with the front seats all the way back. I would be surprised if this car didn?t win best car of '09.
