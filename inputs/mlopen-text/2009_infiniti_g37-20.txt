2009 infiniti g37
I've had this car for 3 months, 2000 miles. Overall, great car. Comfortable, good performance, great fit and finish. Getting 20-21 mpg mostly city driving. Nitpicks... While the seating is comfortable, the head room is tight. Unless I sit near the bottom of seat height adjustment, my heads hits the roof, I'm 5' 11". Bose radio is good, not great. Transmission lower gears are not well matched, winds up to quickly going, jerky when slowing down.
