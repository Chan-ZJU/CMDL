2009 honda cr-v
I just picked this car up tonight and already am in love. I just came off a lease of a Nissan Murano (2006), and while I enjoyed the Murano, I love my Honda. This is the first Honda I have owned. I did plenty of research before leasing this SUV. I looked at the Rav 4, Rogue, Escape, etc. The reviews on the CR-V blew the competition out of the water. I read all of the previous reviews, and again, just picked it up 4 hours ago, so at this point I have no complaints about anything. Looking forward to 36 months of BLISS in this car. LOVE IT!!!
