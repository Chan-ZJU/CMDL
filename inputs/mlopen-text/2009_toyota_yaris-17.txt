2009 toyota yaris
I originally planned to get a used Camry or Accord but found that vehicles 2 years old with 40-60k miles cost more than my new Yaris. When I first saw the Yaris I almost laughed as I am 6'4" and I thought "No way will this work". I got in and was quite surprised at the room for my legs and head. I also had tried out a Scion HD and my head was touching the ceiling. And to be honest, I really liked the Honda Fit....but not for $3,000 more. First tank I got 37 mpg and I have had it a month now and have filled up twice. Don't miss the weekly visits to the gas station. The manual trans is smooth and fun and the center instrument panel and controls are just fine. No regrets!
