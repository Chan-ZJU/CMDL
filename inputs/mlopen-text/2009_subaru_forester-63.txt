2009 subaru forester
I traded in my '03 Forester (which I loved) for an '09 and I'm very happy I did. The '09 has a quieter highway ride and much improved interior room, both front and back. It has a slightly higher stance which makes it easier to get in and out of as well as improved visibility in traffic. It has a sportier looking dashboard -- I like the blue gauges. Clutch and transmission have a much smoother feel, and the Incline Start Assist is a big improvement over the old hill-holder function. The double wish bone rear suspension gives slightly better handling and a much smoother ride in most road conditions.
