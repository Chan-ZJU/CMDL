2009 cadillac cts
The CTS is by far the best riding vehicle I have owned. The Styling is second to none. The CTS handles well at all speeds. Drives extremely smooth and very quiet. Excellent Quality. This car is best in class. Looked at all the competitors, CTS beat them all in price and value. GM did a great job with the CTS I highly recommend this vehicle.
