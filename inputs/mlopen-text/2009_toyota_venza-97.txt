2009 toyota venza
Dealership experience good. This very nice car has been spoiled by inferior power steering, which has a "sticks" in the neutral (straightforward) position. I tried another identical model which had the same problem. The dealership said this was due to the "new"electronic power steering, and they and Toyota told me it could not be rectified. My previous car the Lexus Rx had perfect steering. It is a shame that they did not use the same steering on the Venza. As a result I would not recommend the Venza to buyers of this class of car.
