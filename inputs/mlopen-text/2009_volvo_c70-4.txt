2009 volvo c70
I just purchased this vehicle last week and love everything about it. I am a big man and fit in the vehicle just fine. It is a great car to show off and certainly gets everyone's attention when it changes. My kids have named the car after Jazz in the Transformer movie because it really is a noticeable change. I like the feeling of security that the car brings and I am very pleased with the performance. The car has plenty of power actually more horsepower than the V6 Mustang convertible that I was also considering. It really is two cars built into one.
