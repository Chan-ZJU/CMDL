2009 acura tsx
Test drove both the TL  TSX and the TSX is a lot more fun to drive so I bought it. Love the interior and overall exterior, unsure about the huge grill. I'm just hoping that it isn't a rock magnet. Performance and mpg are fine for my taste. My complaints are minor ones: way too much glare from the navi window, no inside gas door release, I can see it freezing it up in the winter, and when using the bluetooth it's annoying to say dial or call a number and then having to confirm what you want to dial. Great handling car in the city and definitely comfortable. Simply love the car.
