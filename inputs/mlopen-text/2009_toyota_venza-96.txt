2009 toyota venza
Proud owner of a FWD V6 Venza w/ premium package for over a month. Ride isn't as bad as others have complained -- we do feel some of the bumps on the road, but it's nothing to lose sleep over. Storage capacity is incredible; we've taken ours for a 1200km shopping trip and was able to load quite a bit of stuff in the rear. Fuel economy is alright, considering it's a v6 (avg about 23mpg mostly city so far). The amount of power  torque in the V6 is pretty amazing; I'm not surprised if this thing can do 0-60 in 6.5 secs!
