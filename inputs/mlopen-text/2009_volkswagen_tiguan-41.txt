2009 volkswagen tiguan
I loved the looks and still do, but I have had this thing in the shop 4 times: transmission, engine light, major vibration at highway speed - twice. I spent a great deal of time researching before I bought a VW. I wish I had paid more attention to a few reviews that I had seen referencing quality problems. I feel like I have no choice but to sell before the warranty runs out.
