2009 acura tsx
Had an 06 TSX and traded it for a pre-owned 06 Mercedes E350. Immediately started having problems with the Benz. Traded back to an 09 TSX w/Tech and have never been happier. Yes, suspension is a little rough but I love the feel of the road and the fun it is to drive. I'll never leave Acura again.
