2009 bmw 5 series
I am spoiled to BMWs. Each one seems to get better. My '09 528i is very solid. I had an '06 530i which got great mileage and I'm hoping this car will get better as I get more miles on it. The shifting is silky smooth and build quality is good. The improvements in the idrive are notable - pushbuttons for CD, Radio, Telephone, etc. It's a little pricey but it's worth a little more if you're enthusiastic about what you drive.
