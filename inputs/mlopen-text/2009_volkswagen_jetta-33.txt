2009 volkswagen jetta
Pondered over buying this car for months. I am glad I pulled the trigger. Lots of power, sweet 6 speed. Build quality is great, better than the BMW, Audi,or Infiniti I have had in the past. Good sound system (not great). I think this is the best 21K car sold in the past 10 years. Test drove the DSG and that was pretty awesome but I had to go manual.
