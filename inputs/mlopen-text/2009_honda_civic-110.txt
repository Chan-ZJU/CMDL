2009 honda civic
I recently bough this car a month ago and already drove around 1.4K. Highway mileage is great, I got like 33 mph with air conditioner on. City mileage is not so good though, I am making only 22-23 mph. One of the reasons might be the fact that I usually have to drive in heavy traffic, go little and stop again. Road noise sometime can be a little excessive. Even a little bit of uneven road surface can cause uncomfortably loud grinding noise coming from suspension. Other than the noise problem, the car runs smooth. Always fun to drive. I even sometime intentionally miss the exit on the way to work just because I couldn't get enough of driving this car. Love both interior and exterior.
