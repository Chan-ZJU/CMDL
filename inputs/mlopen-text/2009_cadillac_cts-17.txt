2009 cadillac cts
This is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I could not be happier I am keeping this. My grandson wanted me to get the Cts V but im 70 i dont need that. This has plenty of get up and go. I got it fully loaded for 51,000. It has all the luxury's. MY wife loves it and wants to keep it forever. The heated cooled seats are great. {Cooled is loud on high setting} Love the dual sunroof. Pop up nav screen is a must. All of our music sounds great on this car. A few things I dont like on this car is head room in the back. Storage is nill for cell phone and wallets. There is ALOT of road noise but you get used to it. My grandson is getting a car in a year he likes mine but still is getting the XLR
