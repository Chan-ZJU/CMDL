2009 subaru forester
This is my 1st Subaru purchase and, having only had the vehicle 2 wks, I can say that I'm impressed thus far. Ride quality is superior to the Honda Accord that I also own. Mileage so far has been around 26-28 combined highway and city; mostly highway. I'm expecting better MPG once the engine has been broken in.
