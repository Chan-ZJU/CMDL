2009 pontiac g8
I looked at the 08's in May but so glad I waited to get a Pacific Slate '09. This car is the perfect balance between performance and price and brings back all the passion and enthusiasm for driving that the recent choices between fuel economy or expensive luxury have deprived us of. Driving is fun, fast and effortless and I honestly don't care about no nav since getting there in this car is 'all' the fun.
