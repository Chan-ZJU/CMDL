The Art of War
Written around the 6th century BC, The Art of War is one of the oldest books about war and military strategy, and probably the best. For more than two thousand years, Sun-tzu's The Art of War has provided leaders with essential advice on battlefield tactics, managing troops and terrain, and employing cunning and deception. Above all, it teaches how, when battles commences, to think on your feet and catch your enemy off guard. An elemental part of Chinese culture, it has also become a touchstone for the Western struggle for survival and success.
