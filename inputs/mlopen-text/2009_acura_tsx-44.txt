2009 acura tsx
If you look outside of Edmunds there are so many negative reviews on this car, but honestly I have no idea what these people are talking about. You get so much technology and bells in whistles for the price compared to VW, Audi, BMW or even Lexus. I looked at them all and even though all those cars were good in their own right I felt the Acura was the one to get. I am 6'2, 250 and find the seats very comfortable and the car a pleasure to drive. This car has the perfect blend of great gas mileage without having the usual sacrifice of an under powered engine.
