2009 scion tc
After a rather long process I picked up my 09 TC and am very happy with pretty much everything about it. The basic stereo sounds quite decent and the tiny sub actually does a decent job of filling in the lows. Make sure to hold the SSP button for 5 seconds and change the mode from Tc (xB sounded best to me). The car feels plenty strong for normal driving and takes hills happily. Only cons I can think of so far are that the steering wheel sits a bit low (or the seat is high) and sits a bit too far forward so either it's a bit far from you or the pedals are too close. The clutch also has unusually long travel which is a bit odd. Overall I am very happy, looks and drives great!
