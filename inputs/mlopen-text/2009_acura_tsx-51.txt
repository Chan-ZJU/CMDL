2009 acura tsx
I had a 2007 Acura TL with only 11,000 miles on it. I sold it and am glad I bought the 2009 TSX. It's quieter, handles better and the gas mileage is much improved : I went from averaging 20mpg to 28mpg. That's an approximate savings of almost $600 annually based on the 10,000 miles I drive. The TSX's looks are complimented by people that see the vehicle. It's an all around enjoyable car to drive and as much as I liked my TL, I like my TSX better.
