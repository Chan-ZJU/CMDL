2009 mazda cx-9
I was hit broadside (T-boned) on the passenger side at an intersection. Lady ran a red light and hit me. I must say I am thankful I bought the CX- 9. The side curtain airbag deployed instantly (no white powder, clean) the doors and structure took the impact and protected me, I was completely unhurt. While both front and rear doors were completely crushed the doors did not bend into the inside, the side windows did not break. As a matter of fact the doors STILL opened and closed. Mazda has built an extremely safe and exceptional vehicle. The CX-9 was repaired (two new doors)and is back on the road as good as new. Feel free to read my previous review dated 1/13/09. Thanks Mazda, life saver!
