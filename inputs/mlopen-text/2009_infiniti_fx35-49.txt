2009 infiniti fx35
Traded in my 2003 fully loaded FX35 for the 2009 with everything except for DVD this time. Like others wasn't crazy about looks such as grille and new color choices but, my Mojave Cooper w/mad-frown and wide arched hood has really grown on me. The DCA technology is the most impressive, actually pushes back off gas pedal and applies brakes when it detects a car in front, even in stop and go traffic. Other music and nav tech features are really fun. I don't understand how they made it faster and yet get slightly better MPG too, have not averaged below 20 yet after 2K miles. Braking and handling has also improved much over my 2003.
