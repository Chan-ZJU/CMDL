2009 volkswagen tiguan
I've been researching this next car purchase for well over a year. I'm so glad we waited to pull the trigger until after the release of the Tiguan. After researching and driving the competition, the Tiguan was the clear choice for us. Love pretty much everything about this car and could not be happier with our purchase.
