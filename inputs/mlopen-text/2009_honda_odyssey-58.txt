2009 honda odyssey
Look the its a good van, but way too much for the price. I should gone with my gut instincts and bought the Toyota Sienna. I listened too much to Model Review experts and not my heart. The Sienna rode like a dream, much better in my opinion than the reviews. The Honda makes a louder noise when accelerating on the highway than the Sienna. Toyota also offered a lot more standard features than Honda did. I listened to my wife and I should have changed her mind. Honda is good, but the Sienna' s Style, performance and overall quiet powerfully safe "star rating" is superb. I am probably going to trade in my Honda for the Sienna.
