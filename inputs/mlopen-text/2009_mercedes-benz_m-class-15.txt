2009 mercedes-benz m-class
Well it time for an update on my ML550. I put on 6,000 miles and so far not much problem to report. I had to make one stop to the dealer to date and that was for a recall notice I receive to fix some hydraulic problem and tail light seal. The truck was drop off in the morning and i picked it up about three hours later. some noticeable comments: 1) there is a click noise in the cold when you first start the car. 2) With the window down a loud noise is heard when switching from park to drive or reverse. The dealer said this is normal and is due to the large solonoid. 3) The radio went off but no display came on. The radio came back on after the vichele was turn off and back again.
