2009 toyota venza
Purchased my Venza in February and love it. It turned 5900 miles today and every day I find it a pleasure. Had a late meeting last night and was driving home after a long day, turned on the JBL and just coasted home. This car is a true pleasure to own, drive, and enjoy. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to see more of them on the road, so guess my days of being a trend-setter are over!
