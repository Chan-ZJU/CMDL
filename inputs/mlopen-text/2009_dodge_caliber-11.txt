2009 dodge caliber
I selected the Caliber SXT a/t w/2.0 CVT. I drove 4 models over two months. The total rebates motivated me to buy, plus my shiny Red Caliber was a minimum of 20% less compared to competitors model's which would have fit my wants and needs. It has plenty of power for my mountainous terrain. It's quick enough to pass others safely on two lane roads. At 25 to 45 it provides a comfortable stress free ride. It's smooth, even "cushy." Same applies when driving at 70 mph on busy interstate highways. It fits a lot of gear: boxes, cases, stuff, amps, guitars, keyboards, drums, even an upright bass! My wife also likes driving it.
