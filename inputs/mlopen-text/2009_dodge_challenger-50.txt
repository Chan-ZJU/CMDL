2009 dodge challenger
I have found the fountain of youth and its parked in my driveway. My kids are 8  11 and they are already fighting over who will get this car when they can drive! I'm kinda thinking they will need to get there own! My daughter said I am not cool enough to drive this car. Maybe not, but I look good and feel good every time I get behind the wheel! I haven't felt this way about a car in a very long time! I don't know were Detroit has been the past 25 years but they finally got something right!
