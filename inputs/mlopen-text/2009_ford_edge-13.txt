2009 ford edge
I just purchased a new Edge for my wife and we are both very satisfied with our choice. The car has great styling, feels very solid and drives and handles surprising well. You can't beat the comfort and roominess, especially in the back seat. Despite the complaints of some critics, I find the interior quality to be quite good and the materials seem very durable. The Edge equals or exceeds most of the foreign made equivalents that we tried and at a much better price after dealer and factory discounts. Have you driven a Ford lately?
