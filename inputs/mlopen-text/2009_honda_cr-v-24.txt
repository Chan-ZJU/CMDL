2009 honda cr-v
I love my new Honda CRV!! It is so fun to drive, easy to operate, and very kid friendly. I am getting 21-22 mpg (mostly city driving) but I've only owned the car for 3 weeks. Hopefully, that will improve a little as time goes on. I just added two accessories, the roof rack and the moon roof visor which really added to the overall appearance of the car. I traded in a Pontiac G-6 for my CRV. All of my groceries fit into this car - all $350.00 worth! I test drove a Pontiac Torrent, and a Rav4 before the Honda. I definitely made the right choice. Love it!
