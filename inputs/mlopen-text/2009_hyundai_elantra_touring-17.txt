2009 hyundai elantra touring
I drove Automatic version of Elantra Touring and felt its slugglish climbing steep hills near Ski lift areas, so naturally I chose manual transmission when I purchased the vehicle. And.. Voila! It's surprisingly fun to drive. No problems at all climbing steadily at AVG of 29.8MPG up and around Mt. Baldy and Big Bear ski resort in So Cal. with 2 adults and 3 teenagers in the car and snowboard gears on the roof. The fuel consumption on HWY is very good at 35.4 MPG. I use this car for commuting to L.A. now. The car is a turnheaded one too since there is only small numbers in So. Cal. I 've got compliments from strangers often at the parking lots. Inside is so quiet, only heard when over 4rpm.
