2009 pontiac g5
Needed a new vehicle to use primarily to run around town that would be economical. Noticed the G5 on Pontiac web site. Sticker on vehicle we purchased was over $22500, but GM knocked off $2500 from the start, plus another $2500. off with incentives. The vehicle is a silver GT model which is well loaded (XM radio, remote start, sunroof, automatic, etc.) It rides nice, handles well on 17" rims and is comfortable. It is small interior wise, but we knew that going in. It seems well-built and the whole family is well pleased with it. It may not have a "pure-bred" pedigree since it's basically a Cobalt, but it is much nicer than we'd anticipated! We are glad we gave it a look.
