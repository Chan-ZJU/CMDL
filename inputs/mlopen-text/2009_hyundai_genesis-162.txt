2009 hyundai genesis
This car is everything I hoped it would be and more. It is designed to maximize the aspect of pleasure behind the wheel without going overboard. It is super quiet, has a magnificent stereo, air conditioned driver's seat, good visibility, comfortable seats, etc. Mechanically the car is totally satisfactory.
