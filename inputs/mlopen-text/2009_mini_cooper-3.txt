2009 mini cooper
The salesman told me it handles like a go cart. I concur. He didn't tell me to expect better gas mileage than advertised. I get 30 mpg around town and over 40 mpg on the highway. Amazing. Very happy with this two seater, the back seat is a joke which I was prepared for before I decided on this great car.
