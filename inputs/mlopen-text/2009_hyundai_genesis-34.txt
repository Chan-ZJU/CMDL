2009 hyundai genesis
I am a long-time dedicated American car owner. This time after dissatisfaction with the American choices available I reluctantly begun to shop foreign cars. a friend suggested taking a look at the Hyundai Genesis. My first look was at a 3.8 and although impressed was not sold. When a 4.6 hit the lot I was done! This is a surprising car with the amount of interior and trunk space, ride, and quality of engineering. If Korean automakers can do it so much better than our domestic models, it is no wonder we are having to bail out our own companies.
