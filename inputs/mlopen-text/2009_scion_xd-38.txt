2009 scion xd
I have had my Scion for three weeks today. Had 6 miles on it when I got it. My kids and I drove it to North Carolina from Ohio. It has plenty of power, handled the hills and curves of W. Virginia great. The size is great really easy to reach everywhere to wash. No chips or dings in paint after the trip, does seem to catch the bugs on front but my husband said my Buick did too I just never noticed. He's probably right.The gas mileage was excellent 31 in the hills, 36 though N. Carolina. Around home it's about 33 mpg. mix of city and highway. Great fun to drive. Controls are all easy to reach. Does have a small blind spot, check twice. I am in love, the dog and husband are jealous.
