2009 subaru forester
Just traded in my 2007 on a 2009. My wife wanted automatic and I wanted her Civic for commuting, so quick pro quo was we keep a subie in the family if I get the new Forester, fair enough for me the subie can be our family roadster. Decided to lease, because I think diesel, hybrid and other technologies are going to be preferred in a year or two. I'm really impressed by the new design, big step forward. If I believe the gas mileage meter it's definitely better than the 2007, even before breaking it in. I'll test it in the moutains soon!
