2009 jeep patriot
I have put 4500 miles on this rig in 6 weeks. I had an AWD Subie that I put 157,000 miles on in 4 years. This is roomy, fun to drive and will go through ice and snow easy enough. I am getting anywhere between 22-28MPG depending on whether or not it is 4 wheel drive or city driving. I bought this because I could not find a 4x4/awd for less money. I plan on keeping it for 30,000 miles. If it holds up I will buy another one with options. If I have any issues, I buy another forester.
