2009 hyundai genesis
I have been a Hyundai owner for about 5 years and have always been impressed with the quality of the cars for the money you spend. The Genesis is absolutely no exception. I went in for an oil change on my old Elantra, test drove the Genesis, and got it that day. At least once a day I have someone comment on how much they love the look of the car. The solid performance rounds out a really great package. Be careful though if you live in colder climates, the car is a real wheel drive which is great when it is nice out, and even in the rain but when it snows, the car struggles for traction (I spent 35 minutes today stuck on the side of a slightly inclined road while other cars passed)
