2009 mazda mazda5
Got the vehicle for 2 weeks. It has plenty of power thanks to the extra gear, and it handles well. It is easy to park, thanks to the large side mirrors. It stops quickly, but with a noticeable nose dip. The sliding doors and the hatch are easy to close. The vehicle accommodates two car seats easily. The back seat is fine for small adult or teenager without a growth spurt.
