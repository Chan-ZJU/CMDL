2009 jeep wrangler
Like most reviewers I was always a very cautious car owner. I test drove a Wrangler and had one ordered and signed for within the hour. Fun to drive, handles great, just an overall fun toy. I would highly recommend the power package, as well as the upgraded sound system. The bass is amazing! Nothing beats a nice Wrangler, with the top down after a long day at work.
