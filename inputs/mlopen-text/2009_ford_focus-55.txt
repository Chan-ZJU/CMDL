2009 ford focus
I previously owned a 2003 Mercury Sable. Traded it in for the 2009 Focus because the Sable had too many miles and I wanted something that got better gas mileage. I am impressed. It has more get-up-and-go than the Sable, rides every bit as well (actually quieter) and has every bit as much trunk space. Not to mention that it is more fun to drive. The Sync system is nice to have, it is good to have that connectivity in a car. Ford was forward thinking in putting this on their cars. All in all, I do not regret the trade at all. To begin with I was worried that the Focus might seem a lot smaller than the Sable. We didn't loose much.
