2009 ford fusion
I bought my wife an 09 V6 SEL. I bought it with 7,000 miles and it is CPO. I got the car cheaper than a new one with all the rebates and employee pricing, but more importantly, it is under warranty for 6/100 K. Because the vehicle has only been in use for 6 months and 7000 miles, that leaves us with 66 months and 93k miles on the warranty. The car is fun, looks great, and my wife really loves it. She had an 06 EB Expedition and did not think she would like the car, but her mind has changed very quickly.
