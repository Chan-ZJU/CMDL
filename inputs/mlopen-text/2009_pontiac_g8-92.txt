2009 pontiac g8
I love driving the car. The suspension has the right combination of firmness for good handling but not so stiff that you get beat up. Plenty of room in the back seat, we can all sit up with out hitting our heads, one of the reasons we purchased this over the CTS. The mileage is about 18.5 mixed, we have 2800 miles on it.
