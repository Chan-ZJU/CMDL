2009 honda accord
This is the first car in 30 years for my wife as we have always had vans and suv's. The 4 cyl - 190 HP is very responsive and the first 337 miles we got 27.7 mpg with 65/35 hwy/local driving. No doubt that this car will get 30+ cruising at 65 on the hwy. The steering is very responsive and the leather seats are supportive and comfortable, no problems with the headrests. Lots of std features. Great deals now on the 2009's. Our dealer bought outright our 2007 Honda Pilot EXL with 13 months on the lease and we got the Accord with no money down and very low lease payments.
