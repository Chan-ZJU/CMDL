2009 honda accord
I upgraded from a 1999 V6 Accord. The bigger body style does not fit my frame. The window starts too high for you to rest your arm, there is little room for your fingers when you adjust the rear view mirror, console too far right, seat not all that comfortable, too long of a reach to the steering wheel (my shoulders get tired when driving long distances). The sporty feel of driving the car is gone. It handles great, performs great but the inside now feels like a grandpa car. I didn't test drive it enough to notice it at first. I miss the feel of the old car. Bummer. And, they limit how loud the stereo will go! That amazed me.
