2009 scion xd
I just got my new XD with the "Cash for Clunkers" program. They gave me $4500 for my 16-year old minivan with 165,000 miles on it. Love it so far. So fun to drive! My dog (Lab) does miss all the room in her van, but the back seats can be easily laid flat, and she'll have plenty of room in the new car.
