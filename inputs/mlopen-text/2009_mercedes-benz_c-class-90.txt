2009 mercedes-benz c-class
2009 Mercedes-Benz C-Class C300 Sport Sedan has met all of my expectations for a sport sedan. The performance and look of this car is terrific. I have a C300 Sport with the 6 speed manual transmission, Premium 1  Multimedia packages, IPod Integration Kit, and the 18? AMG wheels. I have driven many cars of different make, model and price range. The C300 Sport Sedan easily wins in value and prestige for the money.
