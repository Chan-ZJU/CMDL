2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
I was turned on by all the toys. But what a piece of junk. I've owned many pick-ups in my life, but the ride quality in this tin can just plain stinks. You continue to feel a right to left up and down motion much like sitting in aboat anchored and feeling the wakes of other boats as they drive by. I owned this thing for two weeks. My combined mileage of 800hwy and 600 city was a whooping 14.6. I drove very conservative. I was so disappointed I traded it back and lost $10,000.00. It still hurts. I've never hated a vehicle so much.
