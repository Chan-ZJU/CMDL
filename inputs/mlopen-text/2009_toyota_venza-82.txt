2009 toyota venza
Perfect car to travel with because of its cargo arrangement options and seating space. The comfort of the passenger seat was of utmost importance to us. The seat is broad enough, has enough leg room, and recline capabilities so the passenger has positional options during a trip. However it has one defeat-if books or grocery bags are placed on the front passenger seat the seat belt signal sounds. Wish the passenger could do map tracking to specific hotels, food, etc. while the car is being driven from area to area. This would be wonderful for spur of the moment decisions while driving along. Wish the width of the back cargo space immediately behind the back seat was the same as at door area.
