2009 mercedes-benz c-class
I have P1, iPod, 4Matic, and Multimedia, in addition to a regular (not panoramic) sunroof. I was shocked to realize that the rear seat did not fold. I also wish that MB would be more standard in premium packaging. For example, the M-Class's premium 1 package includes parkview camera and navigation.
