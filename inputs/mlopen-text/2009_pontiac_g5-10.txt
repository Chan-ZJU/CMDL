2009 pontiac g5
Love the yellow, Im 6ft 1, 280 lbs and this car fits great. its fun to drive, not what I expected a commuter to be. Controls easy to use, radio good, ride good, road noise very low, build quality good. dont like the light material on the seats and doors, should have bought darker. just hope I can keep my lic. My Son wants this car, wants to dump his old civic.. so why do the car critics trash this car?? I would buy another one.
