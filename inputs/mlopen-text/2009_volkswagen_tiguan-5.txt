2009 volkswagen tiguan
Traded down from a full size SUV to the Tiguan one month ago and absolutely love it. Getting about 20 - 22 mpg in mostly city driving, so a really nice improvement from 13-14 previously. Car drives very sporty, plenty of room inside for a 6' 4'' driver with kids in the back seat. Styling and design are good. My kids like riding in this car better than the BMW 5 series.
