2009 pontiac g8
I was lucky enough to pick up a brand new (45 miles) red G8 in Minneapolis for a week long drive around No. MN, WI and MI Upper Peninsula. I put 1100 miles on the odometer and developed a great first impression of this car. It is tight, corners superbly, handles great and drives like a car much smaller than it's size. GM really got this one right! Acceleration wasn't outstanding with the V6, but balanced against gas mileage, it offered plenty for everyday, long term driving. I averaged almost 24 mpg for the 1100 miles in combination of driving including pushing it pretty hard on some back roads and freeways. Nice car...I'll have this one on my shopping list.
