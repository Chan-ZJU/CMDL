The Stones of Summer
Originally published to glowing reviews in 1972, Dow Mossman's extraordinary debut is a sweeping coming-of-age novel that developed a passionate cult following - even as it went out of print for more than twenty years. It recently inspired director Mark Moskowitz's award-winning documentary film Stone Reader, which was embraced by readers across the country and described by Peter Rainer in New York magazine as a marvelous literary thriller that gets at the way books can stay with people forever.
