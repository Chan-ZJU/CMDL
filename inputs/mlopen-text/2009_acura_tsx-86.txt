2009 acura tsx
I like the car and you can see what's good about it reading the other reviews. But, I did find a number of problems with my TSX. 1. The sunroof seems to make noises at times. 2. The glove compartment makes rattling noises. 3. The audio display (where the navigation should be for TSXs with the tech package) has a glare at certain times of the day. Sometimes, it's to the point you cannot read what's on the display. I have heard that you can get a matte material to place beneath the display to rid of the glare. 4. The front two speakers crackle at certain frequencies. It is, overall, a good vehicle and I am happy that I have purchased it, but there are some problems that should be rectified.
