2009 infiniti g37
I was looking to buy the new Lexus IS250c and then test drove the Infiniti G37 convertible and was sold on it! I bought the car the next day! I love my first Infiniti and first convertible. It has enough power to get me in trouble and is sexy on the inside and out! The interior is beautiful and I love the heated/cooled seats!
