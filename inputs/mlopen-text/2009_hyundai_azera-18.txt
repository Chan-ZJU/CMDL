2009 hyundai azera
After two weeks of reading automobile reviews and visiting showrooms I came to the conclusion that the vehicle that had the most to offer for a very reasonable price was the Hyundai Azera. This sedan has everything that I was looking for, style both inside and out, performance and price. We bought our Azera Limited in early August and already have driven it over 4,000 comfortable and enjoyable miles. It is, in my opinion, one of the best values available to anyone in the market to buy a new car today.
