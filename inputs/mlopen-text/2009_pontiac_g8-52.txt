2009 pontiac g8
After quite a bit of research, I purchased a slate blue, G8 GXP with a manual transmission. It's truly a Corvette for a family of five. It has more space, the same or better performance and is more fun to drive then an M5. I'm not interested in tons of electronics that will only fail and cause problems. This car is such fun to drive, I will never sell it. The fuel economy is great for the power/performance level. I get 20-22 mpg in mixed driving with the manual trans!
