2009 pontiac vibe
I've had my Pontiac for a little over a month and I love it. It's the best Pontiac ever. It's great on gas, which is a great thing when gas prices are so high. The salesman that sold it to me told me that the engine is a Toyota engine and I did my research and he wasn't lying. The car has the durability of Toyota on a great American design!
