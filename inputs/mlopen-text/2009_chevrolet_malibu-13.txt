2009 chevrolet malibu
I owned a base model Malibu previously - and knew that they were reliable cars. This time, I wanted the nicest car I could get. Heated leather seats, remote start, and sunroof were on the top of my list. I expected to pay $30K for this car. Husband got it for $24K. It's quiet, looks classy, and is fun to drive. A good choice all around.
