2009 smart fortwo
This car is fun and versatile to drive. You can drive it in the automated (transmission) or the manual mode. It drives much better in the manual mode and you have more control over the acceleration level and shifting into gears. You can?t compare this car to a traditional sedan, which is what many reviewers try to do. This car is in a league by itself. There is plenty of room for 2 average size people and it makes getting around and parking in an urban area much easier than any other car.
