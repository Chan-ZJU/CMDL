2009 subaru forester
We just bought the 09 Forester Premium, all weather package. We are very pleased with our decision to go with this fine vehicle. The deal maker for me was the value of the car compared to others. It has AWD, electronic stability control, curtain air bags, plenty of cargo space. I like how this crossover handles like a car but has enough ground clearance to see over midsize trucks and mini vans. My only advice is to educate yourself if you never had a boxer engine or AWD system.
