2009 honda civic
I only have 600 miles on the vehicle but I really enjoy it so far. The gas mileage is increasing every tank full and I expect to easily exceed the 36 MPG rating for the car. I wasn't sure I would like the placement of the speedometer but I can't imagine driving a car with a conventional speedometer now!
