2009 toyota camry hybrid
I bought my Camry Hybrid after reading its reviews in Edmonds. I was worried if I made the right choice until my first gas purchase. I averaged 34.9 mpg on my first tank, and then over 38 on my next two tanks. I am convinced that I can average 40 mpg as I learn how to drive this car. This car is both fun to drive and very comfortable. I would like to have a job selling only Camry Hybrids. It would be as easy as being the weatherman in San Diego. The only person that would not like this car is someone that has to be the quickest driver in traffic. The rest of the adult driving world should be very happy with this vehichle.
