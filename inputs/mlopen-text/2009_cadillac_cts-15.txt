2009 cadillac cts
Bought the car new in October 08 and just traded it in. This car was in the shop more than it was in my driveway... from rattles and squeaks to engine lights and a replaced transmission... the car looks great - but build quality is very poor. And GM/Cadillac apologized but were unwilling to step up and make it right (I repeatedly requested a replacement vehicle and I didn't want to go through the lemon law - nor should I have had to with this "flagship" product). I wanted to buy a GM with this purchase to help the cause... but they did nothing to reward my loyalty. Very disappointing all around. The car did look good while I had it!
