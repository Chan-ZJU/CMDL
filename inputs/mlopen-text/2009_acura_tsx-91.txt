2009 acura tsx
I have driven my 09 TSX/Accord Euro for over 3 months and put 4000+ miles on it. My first 4 cyl after 20 yrs. Hate the shake from the engine, (I know the V6 is coming, but for $5K please...) makes the car feel cheap, once accel. it is smooth. The ride is too firm on the highway, very tiring. I've owned sports coupes and luxury cars and don't know if it is the seats (too firm or suspension). Tech pack great, however the XM Radio dynamic range is poor compared to my 06 Nissan Morano. DVD-A and IPOD audio amazing. Who designs cars should create deeper footwells in back seats, stupid. Use the S selection on the Automatic, wow drives like a different car. Too much road noise. Again? No.
