2009 kia spectra
Just purchased my first Kia and my first new car ever, drove it off the lot with 40 miles on the clock. I now have just over 1,000 miles on the car over the last 3 weeks. The car has mostly been used for city driving, my 35 mile R/T drive to work. So far I am very happy with the car. The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city, but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in. One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance. The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out. I love all the storage compartments in the car. The stereo is not bad for a stock system and I love my sunroof.
