2009 toyota venza
Nicely loaded vehicle for the price you pay. Except for the memory seats and mirrors. Biggest peeve! Brand new car with streaming bluetooth capability (A2DP) will not pair with most new phones. Toyota running with bluetooth 1.2. Bluetooth 2.0 has been out for so long. So I paid for JBL Navigation package for the bluetooth and it is useless. Toyota dealer indicated that the venza bluetooth can't be upgraded. However, I know that other dealers have released hardware and software upgrades to make their bluetooth systems 2.0! Disappointed in Toyota.
