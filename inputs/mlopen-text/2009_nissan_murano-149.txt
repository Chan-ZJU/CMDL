2009 nissan murano
Have owned it 4 months. Love its performance, comfort, conveniences. Need 6 cyl for tow capacity. Good handling is important to me. Murano's is much better than Lexus RX. I gave it a 9 for fuel mileage, rated relative to its competitive group. Of course I'd like better. People rave about the Bose radio. I think it's adequate. Overall, to me this is by far the best value in class.
