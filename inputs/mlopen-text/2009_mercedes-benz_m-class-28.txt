2009 mercedes-benz m-class
I bought this car 11/29/08 with 10 miles.This is the best car I have driven to date. The ride is smooth, excellent for long trips. Control and nav are relatively easy to use, not complex as some indicated. This is my first MB. I have 1200 miles on it so far so its too early to assess its reliability. I absolutely love this car so far.
