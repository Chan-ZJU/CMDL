2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
I purchased an SLT crew cab in May 09. So far I've gone 3500 miles with no complaints other than after I got it home I discovered it had only 1 tow hook in the front (should have 2). After several calls and a letter to the customer care center I was able to get another hook. Still no rattles, no leaks, everything is fine mechanically. Gas mileage is 15/20 which is good for a 390hp truck! Plenty of room in the crew cab for hauling passengers. I'm still happy with the looks, performace and overall package. One nice feature is how the rear view mirror lights turn on when you exit the vehicle, nice for those dark driveways, parking lots, etc. I'd do it again.
