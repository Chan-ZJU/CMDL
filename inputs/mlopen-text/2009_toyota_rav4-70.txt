2009 toyota rav4
I just bought a 2009 Rav4 because my Nissan Sentra didn't handle well in the snow. I am in love with this vehicle. It is a fully loaded, Limited edition with a powerful V-6 engine and a navigation system. This car is fun to drive! When I want to get around annoying drivers on the highway, I just tap the pedal and I shoot forward. I also have the smart key entry system, which sketched me out at first, but I find that I like not having to take my keys out to get into my car or to start it.
