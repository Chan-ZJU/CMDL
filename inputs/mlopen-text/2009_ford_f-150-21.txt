2009 ford f-150
recently traded my 2oo5 f150 king ranch in for 2009 same version , the 2005 had no problems but the gas mileage was only 13.5 to 14.5 non towing and 7 or 8 towing two horse trailer .the new truck is averaging 17.3 to 18.5 not towing and 11 to 12 towing.the interior is much more refined with darker red/brown leather that will show less wear and staining then older version.the hood design has been changed so one can see more hood in front which is now sculpted and more enjoyable to look out over.the interior is much more refined with a much nicer dash and center console and the rear seat area is cavernous.Love this truck.
