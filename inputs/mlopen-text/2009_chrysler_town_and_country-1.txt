2009 chrysler town and country
This is a reliable and appealing car that I have had in my possession for over a year in which it has proven its worth. On the interior the features of the car such as the satellite radio make the long rides more enjoyable. The leather upholstery in the car gives it a comfortable feel and the layout in the car provides for communication between passengers without largely distracting the driver. Each of the two televisions mounted on the ceiling of the gray roof provide a distraction for kids, but I have found that they block the driver?s view in the rearview mirror.
