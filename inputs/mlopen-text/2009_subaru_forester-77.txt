2009 subaru forester
Just bought my second Forester by trading in my '04 gem. She had close to 100,000 miles on her already and had never had one simple thing go wrong with her. Hated to part with her but love my new forester even more. Didn't think that would be possible. Also, didn't think I would get as good of gas mileage as I have so far. Avg. 25mpg both city and highway and it is nowwhere near broken in. Extra room is awesome. Ride is awesome. Would recommend one to anybody.
