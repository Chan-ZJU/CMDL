2009 toyota venza
Our 15 year old Mercedes e class was totaled in an accident and we made safety a priority in buying a new car which led us to the venza... It had a phenomenal amount of safety features and was able to make it out of our steep driveway due to the 8 inch ground clearance... When we drove it we were impressed by the feel of the car and by the overall design... At this pricepoint other vehicles don't come close... It can never replace our Mercedes but it is giving us a great safe ride and a big bang for out buck!
