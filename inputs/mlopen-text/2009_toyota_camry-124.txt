2009 toyota camry
Okay, I test drove pretty much all the midsize family sedans and in terms of price, value, comfort, looks, and fuel economy the Toyota Camry won. The 4 cylinder is plenty of power so don't waste money for that and the xle trim is worth the extra money. Very comfortable interior and decent handling so don't expect a sports car ride. I like driving this car. Lots of room front and rear with a decent sized trunk. Lots of airbags and VSC for safety. It even has a knee airbag for the driver. Controls are simple enough but I wasn't sold on the navigation. So I didn't get it. Too many things to look at when driving. Overall, I give it an A.
