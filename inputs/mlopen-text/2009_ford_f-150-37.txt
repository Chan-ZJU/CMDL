2009 ford f-150
We wanted 4WD pickup toughness with a spacious cabin, and a smooth, quiet highway ride. We got it! We drove the Dodge Crew Hemi and the GMC Sierra Crew. In our minds, Ford won hands down. The GMC CrewCab way too small. The Dodge came in 2nd with better Discounts/Rebates, but we felt the Ford was worth the extra money. I wanted the 3V 4.6L with the 6sp Auto. I have seen up to 22mpg driving 60-65. Still has a tow rating well over 9000lbs. Plenty of power with the 4.6L. In my opinion, if you don't need the extra towing of the 5.4L then get the 4.6L. Fit/Finish excellent - no rattles/squeaks so far. My wife never wanted to drive a truck before this one - now I'm stuck with her car!
