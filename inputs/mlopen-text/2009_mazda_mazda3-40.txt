2009 mazda mazda3
I just bought this car two weeks ago and have already put 600 miles on it. It's just so fun to drive. Even though I deprived myself of a manual transmission (it can be a pain on hills), the automatic transmission provides a fun acceleration. Very strongly built, I had someone bump into me (on the THIRD DAY of purchase!!) but thankfully not even a scratch on the rear bumper! The leather interior rivals my friend's BMW 3 Series, and the Bose System is very powerful. However, plugging in both my iPod aux cable and power cable at the same time gives minor buzzing sound (probably something wrong my cable).
