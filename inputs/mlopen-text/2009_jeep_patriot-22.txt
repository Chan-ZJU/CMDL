2009 jeep patriot
I have had My Patriot for 2 months now and have had no complaints. Handling is a little vague at times and I am still getting used to the blind spot. However it is reliable, comfortable to drive and easy to maneuver. I am averaging about 25 mpg in combination city highway driving. The 4WD does handle well in the snow and I like the stability, traction control and airbag safety features. It is a basic SUV but it serves its purpose and makes a good second car. I would buy another one
