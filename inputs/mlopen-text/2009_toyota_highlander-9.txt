2009 toyota highlander
Very smooth to drive, interior feels much more spacious than the Explorer we traded in for it. Fuel economy is good for SUV. Engine seems to work a bit harder than the explorer's did when I need to accelerate rapidly on to a highway, but other than that it has plenty of power.
