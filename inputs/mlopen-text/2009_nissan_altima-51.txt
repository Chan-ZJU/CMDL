2009 nissan altima
I have had my vehicle for 1000 miles now and I am very happy with it. I looked at a variety of cars: used Acura TL, new Acura TSX, Mazda 3 (2010) and a Ford Edge. The Altima SL CVT with Bose is very comparable to the TSX but has a better body style and was thousands cheaper. The voice activation blue-tooth phone is very very cool! Wish the 2.5 had a few more horses for when the car has 4 passengers, but it is sufficient. You can always step up to the 3.5 if needed for a couple grand. It also fits 5 passengers very comfortably.
