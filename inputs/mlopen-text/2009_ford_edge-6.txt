2009 ford edge
I made the mistake of going for the best deal not the best automobile. My choice came down to Pilot or Edge and to save a few bucks went with the Edge. I am kicking myself now. Pilot was quieter, smoother, and had better quality materials especially interior. Can't believe I didn't notice only way to stop cruise is by braking. Edge looks nicer but quality wise doesn't compare.
