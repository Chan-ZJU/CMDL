2009 scion tc
I bought my car in May. I fell in love with it. But about a week ago it popped out of gear (manual). I have just found out that the synchronizers failed and they are replacing at least 3rd gear in the tranny. After getting the diagnosis I looked it up and apparently this has been a problem on and off since 2005. I am hoping that the fix will resolve the issue permanently and that this isnt an ongoing thing. The dealership is currently repairing the car and have been great but they never mentioned that to me when discussing a manual versus an automatic. Even now they didn't mention it was a known problem. I researched it. Other then this issue, I love this car through and through.
