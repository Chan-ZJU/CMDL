2009 mitsubishi outlander
I bought this outlander ES (FWD) base + Conv. pkg in Black on 28 June 2009. This vehicle runs great and performs as expected or better considering that this is a 4 Cyl engine. Fuel economy on a 70 mile straight highway was about 29 mpg, and my usual driving of a 20 mile trip (80% Hwy) gives about 25-26 mpg. There seems to be a very faint buzzing sound, I need to look into that. Lots of cargo room, and comfortably seats 3 avg. adults in the back seat. Seats are nice and firm and are very comfortable on long drives. I am happy with this purchase.
