2009 mitsubishi lancer
Well, I have owned this car for six month's now and it's been pretty good although I have had some issues in which iv'e had to return to the dealer for. As with any car there are pro's and con's. However, there are more pro's than con's with this lancer ES CVT. The pro's are great handling, very sharp looking, great mpg, good power, and a very quiet interior. I did have a few issues early on with the trunk light not working and the rear airbags cover came loose from the clips that held them in place. But those issues were fixed at the dealership. I traded in a 08 Honda Civic LX and I enjoy the Lancer much better. It handles better, and looks better and is more quiet interior and has more power.
