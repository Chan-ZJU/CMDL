2009 nissan 370z
Ok went to dealer today at 1130am and drove out with car at 3pm, went from a 99 Yukon to this, kept the Yukon by the way. WOW, this car is amazing, never owned a Z car, was concerned about the visibility with mirrors, no problem at all, was concerned about being to low, actually feels like I am riding very high and have great views all around. I got the 7 speed auto because with the paddles, my left foot can just provide bracing as I haul down the road. Put over 125 miles so far in one day on this car and tonight when I got it home after taking the wife to dinner and she drove, we sat in the garage and just admired a sexy car, this car is sexy fast.
