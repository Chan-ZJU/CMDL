2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
2009 Ram 1500 4x4 CC 5.7 4wd with Bighorn 20's and 3.92's. Mostly, I like it. It doesn't ride as nice as my 1991 K1500, but just the same I like it. MPG is poor, very poor, and the ride is bumpy. The headrests are horribly hard, but still it's a good package with the employee pricing. Toyota's were many thousands more. Free Sirius a bonus too.
