2009 honda civic
We were lured into a new car thanks to the CARS programs. We looked at many small cars, and found stock shortages at most big three dealerships. I am 6'4 and this car has lots of headroom, but not quite as much leg room as desired. My right leg rests uncomfortably on the hand brake. But not enough of an issue to not go for it. Was more comfortable in the Fit, but the discounts on the civic were greater.
