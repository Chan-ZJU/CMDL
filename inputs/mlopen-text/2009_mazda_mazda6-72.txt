2009 mazda mazda6
After driving the Mazda6, none of the other cars I tested (Altima, Accord, Legacy, Camry) could match the combination of features/performance/style. The acceleration is better than I expected with a 4cyl and the suspension has an excellent balance between handling and comfort. The Michelin tires do squeal too early though. The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use. The GT has more features than I know what to do with. I especially love the blue tooth connection for my cell phone. The only minor disappointment is the gas mileage. After 2 months, I'm only getting 21 mpg in combo city/highway driving but that's a small price to pay for an excellent car.
