2009 hyundai elantra touring
When the Cash for clunkers was announced I headed for the Hyundai dealership and there it was. A Chili Pepper red Elantra Touring just begging to be bought. Took a quick test drive and told the salesman to put a sold sign on it. Easiest decision I ever made. I absolutely love this car. Quick, precise steering, peppy enough and, to my eyes, a beauty to behold (love the color). Throw in great brakes, XM radio, handling that makes Ozark mountain curves a blast to drive and lots of room to haul stuff in and you have one happy owner. I'm getting 29.7 MPG combined. The stiff suspension (which I like)is the price you pay for good handling.
