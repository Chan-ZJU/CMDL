2009 jeep wrangler
I have owned cars and trucks from across the pond for the greater part of 10 years and loved them, that is until I drove a jeep. I did not set out to buy one, I actually was at a Landrover dealer and decided to schedule a test drive in a jeep for a comparison. Needless to say I didn't go back to Landrover. The look, the rugged feel and the down to earth attitude jeep owners have has solidified me in the category of lifetime jeep owner. Its funny I bought my son an 08 Dodge Charger for his 16th and he has asked on more than one occasion when he can trade it in for a jeep.
