2009 volkswagen tiguan
Great car with many usable features. Drives great and has plenty of pick up to merge onto highway. The build quality is excellent. Owned an Audi A- 4 cabriolet before and the panoramic sunroof is excellent. The SEL package has all the need to have comfort features. It is a head turner all the time. The cargo room is plenty for almost all your shopping needs. The Sirius radio is a pleasant surprise as we haven't played any CD's yet. The Wild Cherry color and 18" wheels make for a good looking car. Spend many hours researching the cars in this class and the Tiguan won even though it is more expensive. The gas mileage has been a little low however the foot in the turbo may the cause.
