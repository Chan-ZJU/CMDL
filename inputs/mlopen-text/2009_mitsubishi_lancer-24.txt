2009 mitsubishi lancer
I love the look of the car but the interior is very cheaply put together. The trunk area almost looks like it?s not finished from the factory. I live in Ohio and this is my first winter - let's just say it's going to be a long five years with this car. It definitely needs traction control. I neglected to ask about that when I purchased the car, needless to say had I known how poorly it would handle in the snow and ice would have never purchased it.
