2009 nissan altima
I've had my Altima 2 months, and the longer I have the more I love it. I get 35 mpg on the Interstate and 25-26 in town. I did a lot of research and test drove most of the competition. But when I saw the Altima, it was love at first sight. I have just under 2,000 miles on it and it drives like you're on a cloud. It is quiet and the CVT transmission is very smooth. I love the sporty look of it. I thought I got a great deal for this amount of car. I would highly recommend the Altima.
