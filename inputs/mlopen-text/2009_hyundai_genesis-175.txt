2009 hyundai genesis
Having owned virtually every German and Japanese make on the market, I decided in today's economy, practicality should win out over creature comforts and German engineering. After owning a Genesis 3.8 for just one week, I am convinced that while my decision was certainly practical, I will not lose out on creature comforts, performance or quality. This car is an absolute winner and every time I get into it, I smile knowing that it will cost me less than half the cost of my E320 over the life of the car and I can honestly say that it has better features, comfort, style and performance. This car is a winner and if Hyundai can get the suspension right, they will really be on to something big.
