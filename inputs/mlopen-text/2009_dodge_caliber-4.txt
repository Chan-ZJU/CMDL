2009 dodge caliber
What a great car. I love this car. It is fairly quick, has a roomy and comfortable interior that is easy to keep clean and looking brand new, it has 17 inch wheels, anti-lock brakes are standard and has lots of airbags for safety. I read some "professional" reviews and they aren't so hot. I don't understand them at all. They clain the Cali is underpowered. BALONEY, I say. I have a 2.0 litre SXT and I am impressed with the power she puts out. I also own a 1979 Corvette 350 c.i. and I know speed and power first hand. I'm not saying the Cali is a Vette, but she will hold her own in her class. Anyways, it's all about decent power and good gas mileage for me. And it gets 28 mpg.
