2009 volkswagen jetta
2009 Jetta TDI I currently have less than 1400 miles. I took a short trip of 250 miles and received 47 mpg. This was great. The Sport Wagon would be my preference. Since my walker doesn't fit in the trunk with the back seat up. It appears to be a large trunk but not the depth I would like.
