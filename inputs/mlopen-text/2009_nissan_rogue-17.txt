2009 nissan rogue
Overall this is a good family vehicle. Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2.5S had. To me there's nothing fantastic but, I'm a sports car fanatic. The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though. Also does handle pretty decently for a tall vehicle. Some of it's braking components and suspension aspects are shared with the Sentra SE- R Spec-V.
