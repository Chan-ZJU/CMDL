2009 ford fusion
Got a excellent deal on a great vehicle. Test drove many brands, but came back to the Fusion. This car rides beautifully and the interior with Black Leather is gorgeous. Thought about waiting until the 2010 model came out, but the deal was too good to pass. Car is still brand new so hopefully I'll feel good about my choice a year from now. The bonus is that CR rated 6 family sedans as reliable and 2 of them were the Fusion  Milan. Also, stated that Ford as a Brand was on par with the Japanese brands.
