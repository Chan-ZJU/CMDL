I can't believe how much fun this car really is! it is one of the most fun car's I've ever driven. Definitely best car in its class hands down! It's got comfort, performance, handling, and its practical. You can haul and take four other people with you. This car is a beast! So I suggest going to your local Mazda dealer and driving one of these bad boys!
