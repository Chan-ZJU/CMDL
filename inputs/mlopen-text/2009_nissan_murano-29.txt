2009 nissan murano
All the luxury items make this a great crossover. Ride is very smooth as you'd expect from a luxury sedan, and steering is soft - no feel of the road while you float along. Plenty of power at your disposal when you need it. However, when you are going slow (under 30) with minimum gas pedal pressure, you can feel the CVT seeking the best gear ratio. Car is very roomy front and back for when you have 5 adults to carry.
