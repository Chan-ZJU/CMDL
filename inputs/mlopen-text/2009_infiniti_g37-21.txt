2009 infiniti g37
I was shopping around for a new car and did extensive research on sedans in the same class. Lexus IS, Audi A4, Acura TL, Benz C Class, etc. After test driving the Infiniti, I was sold. This car has got the most powerful standard engine in its class and it makes it such an amazing machine to drive. 0-60 in a little over 5 seconds. Gotta love it! At the same time, the brakes make stopping feel effortless so that you're confident driving such a strong car. Lastly, the interior is beautiful and classy. I have no regrets in buying this car and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent four-door sports car.
