2009 gmc acadia
Our 2009 Acadia is the best vehicle we have ever owned. It is smooth, quite and very comfortable. As for mileage, it does better than the sticker numbers of 17/24. On a trip to the Indiana. I held the speed at 65-67 and averaged 26.3 mpg with the air. OT was 99 degrees in Macon, GA that afternoon. Returning, 70 MPH and averaged 25.4 mpg. OT low 90's returning. I have yet to find even the most minor thing wrong with our Acadia. And for me, that is saying a lot, as I am a retired engineer and can usually find something wrong with everything. But not this vehicle! We are totally satisfied. I congratulate GM for a quality build and for designing and producing this great SUV.
