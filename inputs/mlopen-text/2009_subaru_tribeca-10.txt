2009 subaru tribeca
Just traded in my 06 B9 Tribeca and bought an 09. The handling on these SUVs are great and the ride comfort is best in class. The engine has plenty of power and gets 25mpg on the highway. The second row has limo like leg room and can easily handle adults over 6ft tall. And best of all it has Symmetrical AWD which gets me through over a foot of snow with no problem.
