2009 pontiac g8
I just purchased a 2009 Pontiac G8 with the 3.6L V-6 a couple of days ago, and I'm saddened that GM is killing Pontiac. This car is absolutely the best car I have ever owned. I honestly feel that this is also the closest GM has ever come to the BMW 3 series. If Pontiac has to die, then why can't Chevrolet pick up the G8 as a Chevelle or something. At the price this car is an unbeatable bargain, and if I had the money I would by another one tomorrow (a GT). The only change I would like to see is for the 300hp direct injected V-6 to be installed. Then it would be absolutely perfect.
