2009 ford edge
I purchased a brand new 2008 Ford Edge back in March 2009 and I love the car. It feels like a real car. Its performace is awesome and not to mention its outside and inside design. Even my wife wants to drive my car more often than her Honda Pilot. The Sync system is great and if you are into technology, you will enjoy it even more. I must say that Ford really scored a 10+ on this one.
