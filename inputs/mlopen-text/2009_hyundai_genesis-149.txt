2009 hyundai genesis
I researched this auto in depth prior to purchase. After driving it, I traded my Corvette for it! 375HP, accel that pulls "G's", Beautiful finish, luxury leather, 1500 mile trip: 27.5mpg at 70mph. Quiet, cool, beautiful, people ask me if it's the new BMW/Mercedes/Infiniti--they cannot believe it when they see the Hyundai emblem! Acoustics are phenomenal, tech package is a must! I LOVE MY GENESIS!!
