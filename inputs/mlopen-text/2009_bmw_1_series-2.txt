2009 bmw 1 series
I have driven BMWs before and it seems all the interiors all pretty much the same. I would like to have nicer buttons for the radio. Also, I am very disappointed that the mirror on the sun visors do not have lights. What a bummer for such car! Response is awesome compared to the MINI but the mileage per gallon consumption went down 25%. The handling of the car does not compare with the so much fun go- kart driving of the MINI. I guess I compromised on that. Overall I am happy with it.
