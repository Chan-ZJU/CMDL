2009 gmc sierra 1500
I'm just pleased to death with my purchase. I got the SLE Crew Cab with the 5.3l ad Texas Edition pkg. I also got leather and all sorts of extras for $30k. Just looking at the truck is pleasing, it's gorgeous, I got the Stealth Grey Metallic with cashmere interior. I get comments all the time on it's color, even my wife says it's beautiful! I wasn't aware that the SLT had a different interior layout, but I do like the way mine looks. It could use some wood in the interior, but that's all I'd add. The small details are impressive. The fit and finish is amazing. The tactile feel of everything is amazing, the leathers, it's just quality through and through.
