Simple Acts of Faith
The beloved art of Normal Rockwell chronicles small-town America and reflects the simple kindnesses that paint ordinary life with shades of the extraordinary. This gathering of select Rockwell classics is joined by stories that illuminate acts of goodwill that transformed people's lives: A cycle shop owner gives Lance Armstrong his first bike, and the rest is history. The young, hurting Frank Peretti is shown compassion that opens up his heart. One man's sharing of faith changed the life of shoe salesman Dwight L. Moody. Norman Rockwell fans, Americana collectors, and those who cherish an uplifting look at life will treasure this celebration of family, community, and the goodness that overflows from the simplest acts of faith.
