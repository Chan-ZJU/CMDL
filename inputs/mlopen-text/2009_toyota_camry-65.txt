2009 toyota camry
Have owned the car for 2 months. Best features are the smooth and quiet ride. I recently rode in a friend's new Accord and the Camry is much more quiet and much smoother. The engine is very quiet at idle, and at 70 mph. The handling is not very sporty thanks to the drive-by-wire steering; needs more road feel. The car downshifts too much when going up slight grades at interstate hwy. speeds; otherwise the transmission is very smooth and shifts seamlessly. This is a five- speed and I can only imagine that the new 6-speed would have more of the downshifting problem. Overall I really like the car and believe it is a good value in the midsize category. I don't regret the purchase at all.
