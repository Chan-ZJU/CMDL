2009 acura tsx
I recently purchased 2 09 TSXs for my wife and son. I own an 07 MDX. Acura is smart in providing a great deal of similarity between all models. The 09 TSX now becomes the little brother to the TL as opposed to the being the big brother to the Civic. My wife had an 05 TSX which we added the ground effects package to to make it stand out. Nothing was really functional and the 09 has seemed to incorporate this in its styling while bearing strong similarities and function to my Tech MDX. Nice ride, excellent handling and eye catching styling. Reliability has always been great and so far gas mileage is as advertised. I have owned a lot of high end. This is the best for the bucks.
