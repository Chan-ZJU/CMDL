2009 honda accord
I looked at the Hyundai, and Altima but I went for the better quality Honda. Every three years my lease is up and I try hard to stray away but fortunately every 3 years I make the right choice. This Honda is bigger than the Altima, Camry, Hyundai and just about as big as the BMW 5 series sedan. There is just enough of what you need here, and still remains very competitive in price and quality. I am happy with the interior quality, I am happy with the drive, and this is overall a very classy reliable car so far!
