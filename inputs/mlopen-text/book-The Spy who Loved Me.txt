The Spy who Loved Me
James Bond has known quite a few women but the beautiful Vivienne Michel was different. Trapped in the Canadian backwoods, with two hit-men on her trail, only one man can save her from becoming the ex-Ms Michel -- James Bond: the spy who she hopes can save her, and the spy who will love her.
