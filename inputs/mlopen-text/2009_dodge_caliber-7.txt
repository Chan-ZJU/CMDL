2009 dodge caliber
Took the new car on Vacation. We love it. The car drives great. The elevated seating is awesome. The Sirius satellite radio is great. Good MPG. The Chill Zone is cool. We love the car. There is nothing else like it out there. The Fit is El-Cheapo compared to the Caliber. The Vibe is nice, but no options at this price. I would recommend a test drive. It is one great car.
