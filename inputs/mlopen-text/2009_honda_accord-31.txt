2009 honda accord
I love this car to death. I drove an '88 pathfinder for 8 years and finally upgraded to this beautiful baby. I love everything about it. The ride is tight and smooth, the sound system is crisp, the seats are perfect (everyone else is crazy to say anything bad about them). The only complaint I have is that there is no fuel economy gauge so that I can tell how well I'm doing with the mileage but that is relatively minor. I would recommend this car to pretty much anyone.
