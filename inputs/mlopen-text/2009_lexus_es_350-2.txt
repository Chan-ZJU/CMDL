2009 lexus es 350
Just got a 09 ES 350, with premium plus package and extras at invoice. Great value compared to G37, Maxima SV, Genesis and CTS. Ride is very comfortable, obviously not sporty, but it's also not "Buickesse" either, unlike some reviews have stated. The engine is very smooth and really moves this vehicle in manual shift.
