2009 scion tc
They pretty much look the same but I did notice some slight differences. For one, the seats are darker. When you put the A/C to the coldest position, it says ?A/C Max.? If you have a manual transmission, the shifting is a lot easier in the 2009 than the 2008. I think the gears also rev higher in the 2009. Other than that, they are pretty much the same.
