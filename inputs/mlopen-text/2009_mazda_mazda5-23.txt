2009 mazda mazda5
We have 3 kids and couldn't see affording $30,000+ for a new minivan or a cross-over. This car was much more affordable and will cost much less to maintain. It rides like a car, but has a interior layout like a minivan. We won't be able to tow a boat or carry an 8' wide piece of plywood, but we never did when we had that capability with our previous minivans. The kids love it, but we haven't taken the first vacation in it yet, so we may be sacrificing on space and power when the car gets fully loaded with luggage. I'm a tall guy and I push the limits on most cars. Leg room and head room could be better, but I fit and I like the feel when I drive.
