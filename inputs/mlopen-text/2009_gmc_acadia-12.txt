2009 gmc acadia
I bought 2009 Acadia in March 2009 and have had nothing but problems. The dealership has tried to fix the air conditioning and pick up with no resolve of problem. LV is very hot and w/o good air, it is impossible. Freeway driving is terrible when a Prius passes you up with no acceleration. Car has been in shop several times with no fix. I would not recommend this car if they all drive the same way. No one wants to actually fix the problem. It may be a LEMON. GMC does not seem to care. So GM cars with all their problems may best be avoided to buy until they resolve to take care of customer problems or replace their LEMONS. Milage has averaged less than 17 miles to gallon more like 15 even HWY
