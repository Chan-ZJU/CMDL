2009 hyundai genesis
I've owned Bimmers, Acuras, and a VW, however, the Genesis is the piece de' resistance... the ride is amazing.. completely comfortable. Phenomenal interior design and layout, with easy access to buttons, controls, etc. Gas mileage is a wonder- Jacksonville, Florida to Miami on 1 tank of gas (without reaching "Low Fuel Notification".. Very impressive for a car this size. The stereo is amazing, and sounds even better with real dvd movies, DVD audio, or a USB flash drive w/ high quality files :)
