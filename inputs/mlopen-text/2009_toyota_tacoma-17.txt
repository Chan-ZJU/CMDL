2009 toyota tacoma
My previous truck was a "plain vanilla" 1993 4-cyl 2-WD Toyota pickup, so this was quite an upgrade. Power windows! AC! Reviews describing as a car on the inside, truck on the outside are accurate. Enough power so far, and the auto tranny seems OK. A great all-around vehicle for driving and light hauling.
