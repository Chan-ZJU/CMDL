2009 subaru forester
 2.5x has good value. Can't find anything out there with all those features. So far I am pleased with it. No rattles but they have cut corners with hard plastics, cheap looking and feel carpet and roof line cover. Silver on dashboard reflects on outside mirrors. Stereo is very sad. Upgraded with there tweeter and subwoofer and still sounds so-so. Gas mileage not that great. Considering the price, you get a lot of room, I am 6- 3", feels comfy, all wheel drive, handles well, many safety features, room in the back. If it turns out reliable like older ones I'll be very happy.
