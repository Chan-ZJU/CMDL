2009 gmc acadia
We`ve just traded our 2007 Honda odessy for a 09 Acadia, great vehicle. Feels big because it is, fun to drive, good looks, roomy interior and the kids loike it too. Gets expensive very quickly if you aren`t careful with the options, in dash 6 cd changer should be standard as well as a back up camera. Overall ( so far ) a great choice and a much better value then the Honda.
