2009 acura tsx
We purchased our new TSX a few days ago and love it so far. Got the base model without the technology package which I felt was not worth $3000. I personally feel this car looks best in a dark color so we went with crystal black pearl with parchment interior. I traded a Nissan Altima for this car which had been reliable but I never liked the look or size of the car. The TSX reminds me of the BMW 325i that I previously owned with regards to handling and interior comfort.
