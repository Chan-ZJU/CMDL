2009 mini cooper
As everyone else says, this car is extremely fun to drive. The "go kart" term gets used a lot but it's absolutely true. I traded in a Mercedes E350 that was nothing but trouble and have not regretted it once. The MINI is everything I hoped for and more. You just cant help but have a fun driving experience when you are in this car.
