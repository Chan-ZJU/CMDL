2009 nissan 370z
I traded in my 2005 BMW 330CI with the sport pkg and sequential manual tranny. It was a quality vehicle and fun to drive. I test drove the 370 Z and felt it was more me than the BMW. It looks great, (turns heads)has rapid acceleration, shifts easily, and corners like it is on rails. I,m 5'11" and weigh 170. The seats are comfy, head room is ample and leg room is good. I now have over 1200 miles on the car (mfr's break in period)and engine and tranny feel much better. I live in East Texas and the temp has been in the mid 90's and low 100's since I've had the Z. 240 degrees is the highest the engine oil has gotten. The Z engine is noisy but seems quieter as it breaks in.
