2009 subaru forester
I was a '98 Outback owner (and proud of it); when the wife and I decided to go new, it was either the Prius or the Forester. We made the right choice as this car is fun, peppy, roomy, sunny and a blast to drive. We were on vacation for 10 days, and we both missed driving it! Everywhere we went, we said, "Wouldn't it be fun to have the Subaru" for hills, curves and wonderful mountain roads... and most especially the Pacific Coast Highway. No rattles, good MPG and more room and visibility than we know what to do with! So far, a worthy successor to my beloved Outback (160k miles).
