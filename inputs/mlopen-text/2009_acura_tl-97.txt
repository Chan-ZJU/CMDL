2009 acura tl
I just bought this car and really have enjoyed it. I got the tech package with my vehicle and it is taking me some time to get accustomed to all the features the car has to offer. I really like the hard drive and USB feature on the car. It does ride very smoothly and handles very well on the road. It is well worth the $$. I test drove the BMW 328 and 335 series and liked the Acura TL much better.
