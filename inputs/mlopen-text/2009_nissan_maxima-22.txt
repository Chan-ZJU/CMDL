2009 nissan maxima
Mine is the SV model with sport package. It lives up to the hype and then some, it's a truly great 4 door sport car and it drives as well as an Infiniti. The acceleration from the 290 HP version of the award-winning VQ V6 engine is great. In most situations the car handles like it's on rails. It's just fun to drive, you'll make excuses to go somewhere because you want to drive this car. The styling is well done too, it just looks great. Especially in black. Lexus and Acura can't touch this for the combination of performance, features, and price. This is a bargain for all the car you're getting compared to an Acura TL S Type or a loaded Lexus IS 350.
