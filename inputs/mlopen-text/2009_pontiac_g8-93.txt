2009 pontiac g8
The car Pontiac should have always had! It's a true American (despite Oz origins) sport sedan that can run with most of the imports costing up to twice as much. Yea, it's not a lux mobile, but the V8 power, the acceleration, the handling (surprise - it has excellent road manners), and the perfect size makes it an excellent value!
