The Bar on the Seine
Visiting a prisoner to inform him that his reprieve has been denied and that his execution is scheduled for the next day, Inspector Maigret listens to the condemned man's story, undertaking a personal investigation that leads him to the Guinguette Ã  Deux Sous, a bar by the Seine, and into the seamy underbelly of bourgeois Paris.
