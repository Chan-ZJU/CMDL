2009 mercedes-benz c-class
We just purchased recently but so far are really impressed with the car. The style is a head turner and the interior is awesome..the high tech. advancements are very high end. It drives like a little sports/race car while has much more room inside than expected, especially with the fold down rear seats. Huge advancements over prior models and it really feels and looks like a MB should!
