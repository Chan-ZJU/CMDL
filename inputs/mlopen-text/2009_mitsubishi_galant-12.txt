2009 mitsubishi galant
I bought this car w/ 16mi. on the odo. And put just under 2k to so far. I really like the front grille and tail lights for 09. I'm about 6'1" and it fits me perfectly. I had a 02 Eclipse and 00 Linc Continental. This Galant is perfectly wedged between those cars in terms of performance, ride quality, features, gas mileage and size. The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system, decent pep when passing hwys, great safety features.
