2009 mercedes-benz c-class
i LOVE this car! It has everything i could want and more. Wanted the new C since it came out and finally got it and couldn't be happier. Drive one and find out for yourself. Plenty of power for me. I just hope the reliability is as good as it seems when new. Ride is excellent in typical German manner.
