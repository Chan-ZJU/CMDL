2009 mazda mazda6
My first new car since 2001 and I'm in love with it. I didn't intend to spend as much as I did, but once I sat in it and then drove it, I was hooked. So many things to love, the proximity keyless entry, the hands free Bluetooth, the great Bose sound system, the seats that cradle you,the sleek exterior lines that hint of speed, and of course, that "zoom zoom" driving feel. Never thought I'd look forward to driving like this car makes me feel.
