2009 pontiac vibe
I must admit that I too was driving my Vibe for the first week in third gear not realizing that 3rd gear is left and 4th(overdrive) is right at the same position on the automatic shifter. That erases my earlier comment on the need for a "4(forward)speed transmission" as the 1.8L Vibe has one. ...not sure I understand the comment about the noisy ride as mine drives quietly---certainly less noise than in the '03 version. Looking forward to 200K miles in this vehicle!
