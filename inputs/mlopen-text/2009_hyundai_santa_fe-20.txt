2009 hyundai santa fe
I just purchased a 2009 Limited AWD Santa Fe, and I am so glad I did. It looks and drives like a luxury SUV. It really has all possible safety features available today, and feels secure. I would recommend any of the new Hyundai because of the huge improvements done in these recent years.
