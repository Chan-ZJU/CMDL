2009 volkswagen tiguan
I just picked up my new 2009 VW Tiguan SE 4Motion! What a great little CUV. Yes, I compared it with all the other little utes. Really it came down to this or the Mitsu Outlander for me in terms of features for the money. That was a great car also, but just can't compare to the build quality or upscale feel of the Tiguan. If I was 20 again, I would go with the Outlander. Now in my 30's, the Tiguan's the ride for me. It was hard to find one with the new Nav system (which is super cool) and the giant sunroof (also super cool), but I am glad I did. Has just the right balance of power and fuel economy, but it is a blast to drive. Drives a lot more like a car than a RAV4. Test drive one!
