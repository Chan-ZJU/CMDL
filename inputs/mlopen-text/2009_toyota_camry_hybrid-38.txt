2009 toyota camry hybrid
 Wow, what a car. The 09 is slightly bigger then the 08 which enlarged the trunk somewhat. It is one good looking auto. Electric motor battery is relatively small and is attached under the rear window shelf. Love the keyless system--when you carry the fob it knows it's you and unlocks the door as you approach. Push button start is very futuristic and fun. Gas mileage is great. My first tank in town averaged 33 mpg. On level road at 65 mph the fuel consumption stayed steady at 45 mpg. Continuous mpg display replaces the tachometer. The ride is solid and smooth and the car handles great. Good power as the electric motor supplements the gas engine when needed.
