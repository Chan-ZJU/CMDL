2009 infiniti g37
Spent 17 months meticulously reading reviews and test driving every car in the entry level luxury class, plus many other categories, before selecting the G37X coupe. Although I bought the car this May, I test drove it during a Michigan snow storm, and have a strong impression of its road grip-handling during both good and very poor road conditions. This car is superb by all measures. It's exterior lines are eye catching and interior refinements are topnotch. Fuel economy is better than I had anticipated, as I'm averaging 21 MPG of mostly city driving. Not too shabby! This car is awesome.
