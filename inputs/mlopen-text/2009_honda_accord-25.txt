2009 honda accord
Nice car but the front RT brake started to squeal. Dealer reports no Honda fix to the issue yet. Still trying to get everything replaced until it is resolved. Also poor gas mileage, averaging 20 mpg in rural driving. Other than that it has been fun to drive so far. Do notice the VCM kicking in and out , could be smoother or perhaps a bypass to go into full time 4 or 6 cylinder mode.
