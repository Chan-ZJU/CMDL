2009 pontiac vibe
This is our 2nd Vibe, the first being an 05, which was a great vehicle. This one easily surpasses that. Very smooth and quiet, by comparison with good power. Fuel mileage has been outstanding. With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up, even though we weren't in the market for a new car. However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one. We're extremely pleased, again. Can't believe GM won't be offering this vehicle any more. Major mistake! Please reconsider, GM.
