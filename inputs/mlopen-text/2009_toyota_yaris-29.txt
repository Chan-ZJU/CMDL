2009 toyota yaris
I traded my 2005 Rav4 (manual) because my arch was hurting after daily 60 mile commute. I opted for a automatic with fuel efficiency and still fits my bike. This one is perfect. I got 35 mpg on first 2 tanks. It drives smooth. Sitting position is excellent. Ingress and egress is better than my Acura. Lots of safety features and a good stereo. I saw a car like this hurling down autobahn at 110 miles an hour last week. My girls call it a little blue jelly bean and prefer to go in this car than our Acura TSX or Toyota Sienna. There is a lot of leg room in the back. Just a fun little car. Toyota should also offer the diesel with this one.
