2009 honda pilot
We set out to buy a Saturn Outlook but after test driving all the competitors, took a look at the 2009 Pilot just to rule it out. Immediately we had to have it. Don't know what the fuss is with the styling, we like it from every angle. We have the Mocha Metallic ext. with beige leather and think it is a very classy combination. I love the drivetrain. With concentration I can feel the VCM but it is very imperceptible. Ride is very smooth without being floaty. Handles great. Very solid feeling, doors slam shut like a Mercedes. Awesome seats and features for the money. Would not mind another couple mpg but easy on gas for a lg. vehicle. Love the dual exhaust looks and sound.
