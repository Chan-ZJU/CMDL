2009 mitsubishi lancer
The lancer drives very well. It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc. It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car. It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant. I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use. The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel. The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007. And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city.
