2009 toyota venza
My husband  I just went to look and left owning a Venza. It's gorgeous in tropical blue. We are big folks, both 65 years old and can't wait to hit the road for a long trip. The comfort of the seats is unmatched. Had a couple in the back with plenty of leg room and perfect temperature. We have been stopped and asked about it several times. Getting in and out is a breeze as it is the perfect height. Its turning radius is great and my 90 year old mother gets in and out it with ease and there is plenty of room for a walker and a wheel chair and groceries! Proud to be the owner. We even named it... Victoria. Check it out asap.
