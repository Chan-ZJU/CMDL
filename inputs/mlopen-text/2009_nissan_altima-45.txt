2009 nissan altima
I've owned the car for just over two months now, and am completely satisfied with my purchase. Mixed highway and city driving gives 27-30 mpg (over 4000+ miles so far). The ride is smooth, the car is comfortable, and I love the way it looks and handles. Passengers have commented on how well it rides and how it looks. It is a quiet car even at highway speed. Another reviewer complained about the sound of the turn signal; I think it's so quiet I have to visually check to see that it's actually on. Keyless entry/push button start takes some adjustment, but is very convenient. Good A/C and stereo with the convenience package. Absolutely no doubts or regrets to this point.
