2009 hyundai genesis
Never thought I would ever buy a Hyundai but I am truly satisfied. Traded in my 540i which was breaking down for a much faster and smoother car. It doesn't handle like a BMW but still pretty nice. People tried to discourage me from getting a Genesis and now they are the ones who are thinking about it after riding my car :)
