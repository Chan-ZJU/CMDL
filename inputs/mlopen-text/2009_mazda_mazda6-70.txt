2009 mazda mazda6
 There are way too many problems popping up with my Mazda6. So much so I am trading it in on something else. Headlight lenses that collect condensate. A/C that causes condensation on the dashboard. The car is 6 months old and it's got problems that shouldn't be occurring in an auto.
