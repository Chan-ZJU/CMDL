2009 acura tl
I love the Acura TL. The first thing everyone notices is the distinctive styling. Trust me, when you see this car in person, it looks great. It's very bold, distinctive and really stands out. Beautiful lines everywhere. The interior is also beautifully designed. You can see the beautiful lines and really see and feel the high level of craftsmanship. As well done and even more so compared to Audi interiors. Everything feels great. It has a powerful and smooth engine that can satisfy all but the most discriminating owners. The ride and handling is a perfect balance between sport and comfort. Drive the TL and you'll see how special this is. It's style, technology and luxury at its best.
