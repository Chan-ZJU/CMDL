The Blue Knight
Don't pass up the incredible values offered in this month's $3.99 promotion with Robert B. Parker's Spenser novel, Pale Kings and Princes, John Saul's terrifying Comes the Blind Fury, and Joseph Wambaugh's blockbuster, The Blue Knight. The Blue Knight is a Los Angeles cop whose beat is a world of pimps, pushers, winos, whores, and killers--a cop who lives each day on the razor's edge.
