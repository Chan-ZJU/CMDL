2009 mazda mazda6
Very Stylish best of all the sedans. Very quick acceleration, smooth transmission shifting. Handles curves like a real sports sedan should, yet has a very pleasant ride on the highway and over bumps, the 18? wheels are a plus. The car is roomy with options that you would normally find in cars twice the price. Overall: The best car I drove in its class by alot.
