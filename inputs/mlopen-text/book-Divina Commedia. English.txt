Divina Commedia. English
Dante relates his mystical interpretation of the heavens, and his moment of transcendent glory, as he journeys, first with Beatrice, then alone, toward the Trinity. Including an interpretive commentary, a glossary and bibliography, this translation seeks to clarify the theological themes and make Dante accessible to the English-speaking public.
