2009 jeep patriot
I recently switched from a Pontiac G6 to a Jeep Patriot. I love it. I am going to be on my own soon and needed something to cart my dogs around in easier. The Patriot drives great, handles well, and is extremely comfortable. It seems small when looking at it from the outside, but there is tons of room inside. My dad, who is 6ft tall, fits with plenty of room to spare. Its been hard going from a sports car to a SUV, but I am happy with my switch, I do not regret this decision at all.
