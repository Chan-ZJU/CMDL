2009 mazda mazda6
after doing research for countless hours, days, i finally decided to get the 2009 mazda 6 sedan. The car is beautiful, from outside to inside. I have test drove the new Accord, the new Altima, and I had the new 2009 Camry SE. None of them compare to this car. This car looks better then them all and drives better. I am a little skeptical on the reliability issue, since it isn't Toyota, Honda, or Nissan. But regardless, this car is awesome. it has things that only luxury cars like the BMW or Benz has. I believe this car will put Mazda on the same map with the Hondas, Toyotas, and Nissans.
