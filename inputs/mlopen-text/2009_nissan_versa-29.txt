2009 nissan versa
I just love my versa. What a fun car to drive. Averaging 26mpg - less than advertised 40mpg - but still am satisfied. Very comfortable, even on long trips. Ample room in the trunk area - and I'm always loading it up with Costco bulk purchases! Two repair problems so far and I'm still under 2000 miles. Driver door lock would not unlock manually, and I needed a new fuel pump after experiencing difficulty starting the vehicle. I've read on a number of forums that this is a problem for many, however Nissan has not issued a recall, just a service bulletin. Despite this, I just love the car and would recommend it to anyone.
