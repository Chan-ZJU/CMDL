2009 buick enclave
We came out of the Lexus and wanted something with more room, but NOT a minivan. We test drove so many new cars recently, and saw this car on lot and asked about it. I was cautious because of the name Buick reminded me of my Dad's car. Once we got in the car, I was shocked how nice everything was. The test drive was amazing!
