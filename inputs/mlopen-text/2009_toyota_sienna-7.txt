2009 toyota sienna
We love our van. I had a hard time getting past the van stigma but once I did I would never go back. This car is so practical. We have kids, and the room and comfort of this car is amazing. It drives so smoothly. It is so much fun to drive this van. The automatic doors is a huge plus. I always worried about the kids hitting other cars when they opened the doors. You can close/open the doors from the inside of the van. This car is made for families. Toyota did a great job designing this car with so many family friendly features.
