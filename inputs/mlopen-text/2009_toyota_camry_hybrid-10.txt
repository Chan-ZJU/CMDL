2009 toyota camry hybrid
After much research I purchased a 2009 Sky Blue Pearl Toyota Camry Hybrid. I have put 1,000 miles on it so far and love this car. The seats are comfortable and for me, the rear view vision is so much better than the car I drove previously. I got 36.7 mpg on my first tank of gas so am very pleased. I like all the storage and cupholder placement. Love the sky blue color - was tired of gray and white. A/C system works so much better than my 2006 Mercedes. The Toyota is quiet. It does have a slight whine when you slow down to stop.
