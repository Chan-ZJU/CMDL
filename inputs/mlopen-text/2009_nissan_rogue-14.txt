2009 nissan rogue
I have read numerous reviews that are all so positive on the Rogue. I really feel like I am missing something. I have only had the car 1 week and I am sooo disappointed I REALLY WISH I could take it back! My main issue is the Huge design flaw (and I believe it's also in the Murano (which really wasn't too much better, slightly bigger, way more $$) the rear windshield is too small! The back seat headrests block the sides of the rearview window!!! This "Crossover" drives like a cheapy made compact car. My other auto is a Sonata and that has a far more quieter, smooth ride. I did Not expect this auto to ride so rough,my 06 Pathfinder had a smoother ride! Rate this auto a 5 all around.
