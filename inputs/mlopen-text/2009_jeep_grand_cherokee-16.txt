2009 jeep grand cherokee
My wife and I test drove a couple suv's recently. 2009 Honda Pilot, and 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Had my mind set on the Honda until i drove the Jeep Grand Cherokee. I was very surprised on how well the Jeep drove. Very quiet, nice ride, smooth transmission, handled well, life-time power train warranty, and way better bang for your buck. Honda wanted $10k more for a little bigger vehicle;(2.9 inches longer). No contest, the 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a way better buy. My wife and i are completely satisfied. For a midsize suv I would recommend the 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee over any midsize suv.
