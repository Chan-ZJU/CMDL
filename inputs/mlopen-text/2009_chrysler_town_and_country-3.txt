2009 chrysler town and country
Chrysler T minivan is a great mode of transportation. Good visibility, easy to drive, nice sound system, comfortable seating, stow is awesome! With rebates, etc., this was my best choice. I've had Chrysler minivans in the past, and this is the best one yet. Mileage is a little weak, but expected to improve with age.
