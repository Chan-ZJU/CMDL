The Sot-weed Factor
Recounts the wildly chaotic odyssey of hapless, ungainly Ebenezer Cooke, sent to the New World to look after his father's tobacco business. The book is a tribute to the most insidious human vices and a hilarious ride through the 18th century in the company of heroes, villans, innocents and rogues.
