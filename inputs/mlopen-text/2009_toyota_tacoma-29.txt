2009 toyota tacoma
I have owned my truck for 1 week and I couldn't be happier. I traded in a 2006 Pathfinder LE for the Tacoma and it was the best decision I have ever made. The Nissan was not put together well and had rattles everywhere as well as a problem in the electrical system. The Tacoma seems to be built much tighter and better and has a great ride. It tows my boat without even knowing it it there. There is a slight rattle at 1100rpm in the passenger door but the dealership is going to take care if that quickly when I take it in for service. I would HIGHLY recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for a truck. It is simply put, A GREAT TRUCK!
