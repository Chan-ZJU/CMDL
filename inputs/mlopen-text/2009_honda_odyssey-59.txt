2009 honda odyssey
I've had mine for about two months and I am very disappointed. Came out of a Caravan lease that had no issues for the entire time I had it. The Odyssey has squeaking brakes, doors rattle, and the DVD player skips. Try telling our 4 year old that the movie has to start all over again all the way to Florida. Not pretty. I wouldn't recommend the Honda
