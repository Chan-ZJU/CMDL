2009 subaru forester
After the first 3 months, I can say this was an excellent purchase. You can't go wrong with the vehicle entirely made in Japan. I had to wait 8 weeks for the vehicle to be made and delivered. I love the turbo.. incredible acceleration. So far no speeding tickets. The interior leather is beautiful and everything is nicely finished, including the metal/racing pedals.No rattling noises so far, may be because of the Limited version. It makes some of the expensive competitors look silly.
