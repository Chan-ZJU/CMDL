2009 pontiac g5
Do not buy a Pontiac G5 or Chev. Cobalt. If you could buy one for half the MSRP maybe otherwise look else where. Seats very uncomfortable. Gas mileage not that good for a small 4 cyl. Mine did not even come with a spare tire or jack. It is not only plastic, but cheap plastic. And I am sure resale will be horrible. Do not learn the hard way like I have. I LOVE AMERICA, but not their small cars.
