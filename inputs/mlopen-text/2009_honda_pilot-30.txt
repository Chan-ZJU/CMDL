2009 honda pilot
I traded in my '03 EX-L Pilot for a new '09 EX-L model. The '03 was very dependable. In comparison, the '09 has a much smoother  more quiet ride. Road noise has been reduced dramatically. There are more standard options and features on the new model. I am having to get use to the VCM technology. There is noticeable hesitation when the vehicle changes cylinder rotation. Some reviews have given the Pilot bad marks on the lack of V6 power. This has not been an issue with me. The dash layout is well thought out with the button locations and instrument panel. The dash read-out message screen is pretty neat with clear and easy to read information. Visibility is good. Got 22 MPG on first road trip.
