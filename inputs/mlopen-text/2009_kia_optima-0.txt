2009 kia optima
I had a 2007 Mustang for 3 years but after many issues and the warreny being up at that time 11 days. I was thinking of trading..found Kia for another car but ended up buying Kia Optima. The car is very good car over all but the seats are so hard and not comfortable at all. My back hurts after drving the car. I would advise really drving the car for more then a short test drive. I did drive the car 3 times however a really long drive would be better. I try to hurry up and get to where I need to go so I want have to drive the car long. The only plus is the safety/warrenty and the radio is good other then that I wish I never got this car.
