2009 honda ridgeline
I looked at the Tacoma, but didn't like the pricing (had to add a whole package just to get keyless entry, another package to get tow wiring, etc). The Ridgeline has it all, standard. I really like the trunk and the way the rear seats flip up for storage. There are many small intelligent things: the heater doesn't blow cold air on you (it waits until the car has warmed up before blowing any air), the driver's window has auto-down AND auto-up, you can lower all four windows with the key fob (great for airing out hot air), and the car gives you your real-time mpg as you drive. It's fun, well-designed, and with Honda reliability too.
