2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
I just traded in my 08 Ram Laramie for a 09 Sport. No problems with my 08 but could not resist the 09. Dodge really put innovation and quality in mind with the redesign. I have driven every full size, and you cant touch the new ram. Power, performance, comfort, tech, and price. It's got a HEMI, need I say more! MPG is improved from 08 average 16 MPG mixed driving, vs 14.5 in my 08. The truck is quiet and sure footed. The new suspension rocks! Quality is not Mopars best suit, but they are spot on with the RAM. I hope this is the flagship of products to come. Don't let the "old" Chrysler deter you, they ARE listening to us, the consumer! Grab life by the horns!
