2009 nissan maxima
I traded in my '04 Denali XL for the Maxima and all I can say is "WOW"! After driving SUVs for the past 11 years, it was time for a 4DSC. The performance is unbelievable and the CVT is superb. Handling is unreal and the acceleration is exhilarating. The technology package is a must and the XM traffic/nav system is so cool, all my friends can't believe what it can do. The lines are beautiful and are better (IMO) than the BMW (5), Audi, Acura TL/RL, and Lexus IS/GS. Wait until you see one in person - the pics don't do it justice. The car is gorgeous!!!
