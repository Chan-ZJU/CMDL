2009 acura tsx
Prior to owning my current Acura TSX I owned an '04 Mazda 3 Sport. I wish I had simply kept that car! The TSX is seemingly slower (much heavier than the MZ3) and has a terrible engine rattle, which is widely reported. Dealers are stating this is a "normal" sound. I would probably be happier with the car overall if it had more power and the engine didn't sound like my 1993 Saturn with 180,000 miles on it. There are also tons of rattles in the cabin, which the dealer (of course) can not duplicate.
