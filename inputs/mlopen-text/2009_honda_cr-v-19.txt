2009 honda cr-v
I carefully considered the Forrester, the RDX, and the Jetta TDI wagon. I came to my senses and committed to the CRV and I'm loving it. The reviews mention a slow 0-60. I haven't noticed much lag in city traffic. The 0-35 I have to do almost every other block around town is zippy. I love the look of the redesigned CRV. They borrowed from the best. The sculpted hood, the curves and points of the headlights...very appealing. Tail-lights were transitioned from an earlier model which evoke the design of certain Volvos. Mileage is around 23 mixed. Hint: go with good gas. I noticed a remarkable drop in engine noise when I didn't skimp and that V-Tec 4 went butter soft, in a good way.
