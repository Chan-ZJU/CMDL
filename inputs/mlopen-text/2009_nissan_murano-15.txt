2009 nissan murano
Unbelievable value and more comfortable than my Lexus RX. Also, there's no shift shock so you pick up speed very quickly. The rear seats recline and have alot of leg room. The illumated gauges and the chrome interior finish have a sports car feel. Go with the front wheel drive version instead of AWD and save money.
