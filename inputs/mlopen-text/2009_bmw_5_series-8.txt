2009 bmw 5 series
First time BMW owner and love the car. Got the Nav, Prem, Ipod link , SAT radio, adaptive xenons and cold weather packages. Was looking at Hyundai Genesis, Infiniti G35x but the BMW blew me away. I really can't wait to drive it. Very quiet and responsive - 3.0l seems bigger and more powerful, handling is superb and the ride is firm but very comfortable, idrive is really very easy to use not sure why all the hubbub- just takes a bit of practice. If this sustains I will be a BMW guy for life. Winding and wet roads are life for me and the car sticks like glue. Fit and finish flawless. Very roomy for 4. Not enough road time for economy rating yet. Stock sound system is very good.
