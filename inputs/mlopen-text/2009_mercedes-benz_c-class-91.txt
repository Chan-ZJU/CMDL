2009 mercedes-benz c-class
Got the Mercedes after having being a happy driver of two Honda Accords since 1994. Then carefully planned a new purchase after having tried many similar size, entry level, luxury sedans, both German and Japanese. Went for the Mercedes for its optimal combination of smooth ride quality, plenty of power (last Honda was around 140 hp), quality built, and of course the looks. Mine came manual (still love the thrill of shifting gears), with all the "high end packages", so came to about 42,000 $, pretty similar to other cars in that category. So far driven it for a week, with a good combo of city and highway mileage, and love it. And any manual car only gets better with time!
