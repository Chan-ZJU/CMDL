2009 dodge charger
I purchased my 09 Charger SXT almost 3 months ago. To date, I have enjoyed the car and the solid feel you get in handling and performance. It is a real head turner, but I have a feeling people mistake it for a police ghost car at times, and slow down when approaching me on the highway, so funny. The car is a delight to drive and the 3.5L has more than enough power for my needs.I have driven Mopars for the past 20 years and the Charger is the best so far. I would recommend this car highly.
