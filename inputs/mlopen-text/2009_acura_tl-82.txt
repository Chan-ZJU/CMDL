2009 acura tl
This is our 3rd TL after owning the 02  06. Ride and comfort are excellent. After looking at Cadillac, Lexus, Infinity  BMW this is the best quality for the $$. The Tech package is outstanding, we love it. The ride improvement is excellent. Drove the 4-wheel version, yes it has more HP and is faster but you give up the smooth ride for the firmer sport ride. The 06 TL was the best road car we have ever had, can't wait to get the 09 on the road. The seats are better than Lexus. The rear leg room is much better than the 06. I do miss the blue dash lights that was in the 06 TL. It's a buyers market, got a great deal. Like the new lines, but the front end needs to grow on you.
