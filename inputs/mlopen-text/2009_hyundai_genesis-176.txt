2009 hyundai genesis
Who would have thought that you could spend $40,000 and drive out of a dealership and own a world class automobile that rivals the 750-I BMW. The electronics alone are amazing but the car has good power with the V-8 and rides very smooth. It also is very roomy and handles great. I bought a Mercedes E-350 in 2006 for more money.This care is quality. Trust me.
