2009 nissan cube
This vehicle has design appeal, something I wanted without paying luxury pricing. The controls in the car are very techno, handling is superb. I had five adults in the car, and everyone was comfortable. Air Conditioning works great, very important since I live in Arizona. My only disappointment is that the Radio is not XM ready. I have contacted Nissan about this, and hopefully this can be resolved without using a FM modulated aftermarket unit. Since I have just taken delivery on my vehicle, it is hard to get into the mechanical aspects, but find it generally very tight and responsive. Great job Nissan design team!
