2009 toyota venza
I have wanted a Venza since I first read about them. I have had the car for a 10 days and it was worth the wait. I love the interior room. The V- 6 provides plenty of power. It is a very smooth ride. My biggest surprise has been the gas mileage. I got 23 1/2 mpg on my first tank. This was about 4 mpg better than my 03 Highlander. I usually would not buy a car in its first year of release, but since it was a Toyota product I felt it would be reliable I decided to make an exception and get the car. So far I am glad I did. This is an amazing vehicle. It handles like a car and retains the versatility of an SUV with better gas mileage.
