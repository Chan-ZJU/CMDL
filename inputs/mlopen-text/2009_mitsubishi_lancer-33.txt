2009 mitsubishi lancer
I got this last Nov and when I got it there is a small dent and the dealer was aware about it and verbally they told me that they will fix it and even give me a loaner car. Now they are giving me a hard time to have it fixed and the 6 CD is missing not even there. The specs on the paper, 6CD/MP3 is the deck w/ navigation.
