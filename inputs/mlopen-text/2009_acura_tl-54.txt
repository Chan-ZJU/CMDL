2009 acura tl
I bought my TL with Technology package a week ago and I love it. I compared the TL to Infinity G37 and Lexus ES350 and here is what I found. The G37 was great to drive but has unimpressive interior and feels small , the ES350 is very comfortable to ride but un- sporty to drive and large, the TL has amazing interior, advanced technology package, fun to drive and but ugly grill (beak). So I decided that was easier to live with that ?beak? after painting it.
