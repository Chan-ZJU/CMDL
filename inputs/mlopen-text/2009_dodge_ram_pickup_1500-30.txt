2009 dodge ram pickup 1500
What a truck. I have owned 6 dodge trucks this is by far the best. I love the looks the comfort(Cowboy Cadillac)and the gas mileage(22.5 miles to the Gallon)WOW!!!! Plus the great deal I recieved. 35000 MSRP Drive out 21200. What a great deal. I looked @ Toyota, Liked the trucked to pricey. Also looked @ Chevrolet. Nice truck but cheaply made. The 09 RAM the only truck for me...
