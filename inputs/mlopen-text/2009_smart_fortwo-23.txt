2009 smart fortwo
Old people have discovered this car, so it is not sold to youngsters only...People ask me if it gets 60 miles per gallon, and I respond it gets the best gas mileage of any non-hybrid sold in America...You can do a u-turn on a narrow 2 lane street,but don't try going fast over speed bumps...The Passion is loaded with standard equipment, including panorama roof,paddle shifters,auto air,electric windows/locks,and ABS/ stability control... The Smart is Amazingly roomy for two...It has enough space in back for a week's groceries...It has style,which is lacking in other economy cars... It is a Mercedes on a beer budget...Resale value will likely challenge Corvette and most Japanese imports...
