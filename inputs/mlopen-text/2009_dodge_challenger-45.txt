2009 dodge challenger
This car will impress you in ways you can't imagine. For years I have wished that Dodge would take the body style of a 1970's era Challenger and put in on a modern chassis. This car has the retro styling without the drawbacks. I have the 5.7L Hemi mated to the 6-speed manual. It was the only option I wanted or paid for. That made this car a bargain high-performance car, especially when you factor in the incentives being offered. It is a blast to drive. It has a tight ride without being too stiff. It turns everyone's head. I love it.
