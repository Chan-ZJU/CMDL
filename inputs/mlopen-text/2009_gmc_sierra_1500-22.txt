2009 gmc sierra 1500
Traded in my 2007 Duramax classic body for this truck. It is the best truck I have driven. It's fun to drive, great build quality. Great highway ride and good off road (but sits a little low) Handles ice and snow like dry pavement. I would recommend this to anybody loking for a change from the rough riding poor handling truck of a few years back.
