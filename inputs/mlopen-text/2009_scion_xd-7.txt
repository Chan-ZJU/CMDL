2009 scion xd
Traded in our 2001 BMW 330Ci  bought the 2009 Xd earlier this week. So far absolutely loving it. Its surprisingly roomy  comfortable on the inside despite not being a large car. The gas mileage has been great. The interior seems to be well thought out for the driver with plenty of compartments  we're looking forward to having this car for years to come.
