2009 scion xd
I went into the toyota dealer looking for a car that I had rented in PR when I was on vacation. It was the Yaris very good on fuel. Kept looking and saw the new release XD which I fell in love with because the color was green which is my favorite color. I spoke with a scion rep. decided to get the scion XD. Great on gas. Size is perfect for me, i'm only 4"11 so it's just the right size for me. I highly recommend this car to all. It has every thing you need.
