2009 toyota camry
Recently purchased the New 2009 Camry SE. I like nearly everything. Would have liked to see slightly softer seating but that is all I can think at this point. Lots of fun to drive, great gas mileage, and the design of the car is very cool. The SE model has average features for the money.
