2009 infiniti m35
I have been a Lexus customer for 12 years. We shopped around and found the M35X. They pushed their technology so much at the dealership we felt it had to be as good as Lexus if not better. Boy were we wrong. Unfortunately I now have 38 months of this nightmare left. I returned an 06 Lexus GS, which my phone the Palm Pre had no trouble pairing with the Bluetooth. My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones. Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation. Then there is the nav - what a waste of money. No points of interest. Been lost a lot lately. $53000 really Infiniti. Entire system was replaced by dealer, no luck.
