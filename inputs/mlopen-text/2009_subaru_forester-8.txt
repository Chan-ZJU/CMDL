2009 subaru forester
I've owned my Forester almost a year now. It's not sexy but it's extremely practical. It's been an absolute pleasure to drive and own. I live in CO so it's been tested in snow, ice, mountains, dirt roads, etc. No problems. The 4 speed auto could be a big problem in mountain driving except the sport shift feature makes it into an easy to use manual transmission! I've averaged 26.1 MPG since owning it, much better than anticipated.
