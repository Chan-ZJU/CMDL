2009 mazda rx-8
Disappointed, engine stalls. Also prone to flooding if you drive it for less than 40 minutes - not good news with inner city living needing you to shuffle parking spots. The final nail was a dropped rotor. Reported the performance drop off to Mazda, they "didn't find anything". Needed a full engine replacement, never again ... and then Mazda Australia comment of "no customer goodwill will be provided". Sure could try the legal route, but have not got the time.
