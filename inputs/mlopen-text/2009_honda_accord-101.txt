2009 honda accord
After buying my first new Honda (CRX in '89 which I loved), I couldn't wait to buy Honda again after owning several other brands. This car gets so many looks and compliments--it's often mistaken for a BWW or Lexus! I'm so glad I chose the V6 model-the power is incredible..also the silver door handles give it a nice quality touch. The temperature and audio controls can be somewhat complicated at first, but I am starting to get used to them. Everything is explained in the manuals, so read up! The heated seats are a nice welcoming feel on a cold winter day. Great job Honda! What an improvement over the previous body style (yawn).
