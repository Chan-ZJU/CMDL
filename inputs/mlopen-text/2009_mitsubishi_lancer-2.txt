2009 mitsubishi lancer
I disagree with the other people saying the fuel mileage is bad. i drove this car from Kileen, Texas to Colorado Springs and averaged around 33-35mpg!!! Both trips. The only thing I don't really like about the base models is the HP. It shoulda been upped a little compared to the newer 4cyl. N/A cars out there, but nice car looks mean in the front.
