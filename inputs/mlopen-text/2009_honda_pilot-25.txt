2009 honda pilot
I purchased the car in Aug 08. and was extremely happy with the car until two days later. I noticed that the steering would pull to the right. I was told it was the crown in the road. Having insisted on something being done, a number of adjustments were made and it drives better. The next issue which has me pondering trading the car in,is noise heard from the gas tank. When the gas tank is full, I can hear the gas sloshing around and it makes a loud thumping noise. The dealership stated this was due to the design of the gas tank and a condition of the car. Take the opportunity to turn off your radio and drive around. Otherwise, it has great space, and a comfortable ride. Gas mileage is ok.
