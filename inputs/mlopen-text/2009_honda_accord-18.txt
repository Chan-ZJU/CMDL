2009 honda accord
This is my 6th Honda that I've purchased new and so far this is my favorite car. I purchased the Accord EX to replace a lease return Acura RSX Type-S. The build quality is excellent and the mileage is exactly what was advertised. I was a little concerned about the seat comfort based on some of the reviews left on Edmunds.com. I can honestly say the seats are far more comfortable than any of my previous Honda's (2 Accords, 2 Civics and a CRX) and also more comfortable than my Acura RSX.
