2009 nissan altima
I switched from the Murano (which I loved)to the Altima, due to gas prices. I avg.30.5 per gal. and can't believe how far I can go on a full tank. I do miss the storage room, although it's generally good. The nav stinks compared to a Garmin at a fraction of the price. The design of the black console is just ok. On long drives my leg leans against the center console and becomes uncomfortable. Generally though, it's a nice drive. The car should have a rear wiper.It does have a Great sound system.
