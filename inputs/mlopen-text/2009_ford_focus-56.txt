2009 ford focus
We rented a focus while waiting for a 20" replacement tire for our mini van. My wife loved it but it was very plain. After getting the van back we stopped by the local dealer and were surprised at the new model lineup. Our van had 75,000 miles and it was time for a change. The SES package was very well equipped. Better auido system. 6 disk MP3, SYNC, sunroof and nice rims. The LED interior lights are cool and ours is an automatic not 5 speed. Got a very fair deal at 15,000. And much more then expected on the old van. It drives well for a 2.0 and handels just fine. Not much wind noise at freeway speed and cruise control is a plus.
