2009 honda pilot
My wife and I were waiting for a this 2009 version to come out since we saw the concepts. My wife has the 03 CRV and that has been a workhorse and we love it. We are hoping that this Pilot will do the same for us. We are enjoying it so far. We had a snow storm and it drove like a tank as it plowed through ice and snow. We were looking at the 4runner and we found that the Pilot drove much better - the drive feels more comfortable, yet firm and responsive to drive, it also feels much more powerful - even with the V8 version of the 4runner. Finally you get more for your money with the Pilot.
