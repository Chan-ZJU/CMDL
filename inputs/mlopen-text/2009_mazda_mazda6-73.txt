2009 mazda mazda6
A little over a year ago I purchased a new Nissan Altima. It was close to a strip model and I was never really satisfied with the car. Checked out the Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder and thought it was a nicely appointed car but the power was not what I expected. The dealer pulled around a Touring S model with the V6. Wow what a difference, I was sold as soon as I hit the acceleration. I got a great deal since they were having huge rebates and $1000 buyer loyalty credit. (Also own a 2007 CX7) I had an 07 IS250 and this car is almost identical in looks and features in my opinion.
