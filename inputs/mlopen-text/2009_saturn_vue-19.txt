2009 saturn vue
We bought our '05 Vue new four years ago and when it came time for a new car we wanted nothing else. Our old one had zero problems with it and had 78k on the odometer. We brought our new '09 Vue home and just love it. We couldn't be happier. The build quality is dramatically better as is the comfort and interior trims. The old one was good, but this one is great. This is our third purchase from a Saturn dealer and the buying experience is always easy and hassle-free. Saturns have many nice options are included in the package price of the car. We don't have to add on much at all if anything. Will definitely purchase a Saturn again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new SUV
