2009 honda pilot
I went from an 06 MDX touring with Nav, RES and running boards. Priced the same vehicle for another 3 year lease and would have to take an additional $100/month out of my pocket for 39 months. Once I test drove the Pilot, I fell in love. I will say that it is not nearly as fun to drive but functionality and space overcome the need for speed. Comfort matches if not beats the 09 MDX I tested. I also tested the GM equivalents including the overpriced fully-loaded Enclave. For a family of 5, and for about $200/month less than the MDX I recommend the Pilot Touring.
