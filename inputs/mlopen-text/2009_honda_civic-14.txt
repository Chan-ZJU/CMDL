2009 honda civic
Bought this car a few months ago and love it. Sporty,looks good, comfortable,solid,and performs well for this class. Not the fastest per se, but balanced in all areas. Opted out of the summer tires because of snow, and it still handles great. Have owned Hondas for 21 years now and I don't regret this purchase at all. 2 tier dash works really well,stereo is decent and USB system rocks. Combination of size, handling, efficiency. The ride is firm, but not harsh, I don't understand all of the complaints about road noise. It is competitive with others in the class. I still love the high revving nature of Hondas,over brute power.
