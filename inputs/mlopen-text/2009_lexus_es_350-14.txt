2009 lexus es 350
I previously owned a 1998 ES300 and logged 154000 miles without a major problem. The amazing thing is that the purchase price of the 2009 was about the same with more equipment standard. If this car is nearly as good as my old Lexus, I will be more than satisfied. I have only driven it about 2000 miles but I am very impressed with the power, quality and economy of this car.
