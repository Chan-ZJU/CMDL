2009 honda cr-v
We test drove the 2008 CR-V and then we test drove the 2009 CR-V, same model and packages. The new 2009 CR-V was more responsive and handled much better and was very comfortable . Even though we we told that nothing really change from the 2008 model we felt a positive different. The deal was good and the car was excellent
