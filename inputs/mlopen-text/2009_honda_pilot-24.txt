2009 honda pilot
Wow, this was quite the upgrade from our last vehicle, so it was a little overwhelming with all the options that came with the 2009 Touring with RES. Still haven't figured out everything. I was surprised at the size of it when I pulled it into the garage. This vehicle is huge, in a good way. The 8 person seating capability is great. Bluetooth phone is great for my wife who can't drive  hold a phone at the same time. The navigation unit far surpasses the portable one I just bought. I hope my enjoyment of the car continues for many years. I see no major issues yet.
