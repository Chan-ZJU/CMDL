2009 hyundai santa fe
My wife fell in love with the Santa Fe a year ago.She never showed much interest in the many cards that we owned including Cadillacs and a Lexus (es 330 2004) The Santa Fe is as quiet as the Lexus. We love everything about the car. It is comfortable and extremely well made. I added molding to the side which added to the look. We had spoken to many Santa Fe owners and everyone said they love it. No one had any negative comments
