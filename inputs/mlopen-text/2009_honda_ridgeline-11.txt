2009 honda ridgeline
Aquired the 09 Ridgeline RTL to replace 02 Dodge Dakota Quad 4x4 with 110K. I really like the Ridgeline and enjoy driving it each day. Solid build, minimal windnoise, even on windy days. Love the trunk! The seating and build is is better than the Dakota. Added an A.R.E. Z-series Cap for ~$2000, fit is okay, but these are not meant to be easily taken off and put back on like most fiberglass caps/toppers. Need to consider if you hall large objects now and then.
