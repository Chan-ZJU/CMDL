service in the Leeds City Council area. The service specification sets out the 
range of Community Home Care services that the Council wants to make available, 
and the outcomes to be achieved as defined by the individual Service Users. The 
city will be split into 6 geographical areas, and one Primary Service Provider 
will operate in each of these areas. A framework agreement will also operate to 
supplement the primary contracts.  
The Community Home Care services specified must be available to all people 
over the age of 18 who meet the Care Act 2014 eligibility criteria for funded 
support. However, the majority of people using these services will be older 
people. This Service responds to two significant developments in social care 
policy: 
���������� A shift in 
focus from service inputs and outputs to the outcomes Service Users want to 
achieve 
���������� That Leeds 
City Council promotes the introduction of Self-Directed Support through 
Personal Budgets, with people having more choice and control over the services 
they receive either through a Personal Budget or by ISF  
�Community Home Care� is a simple way of describing the support that people 
receive to look after themselves and the homes they live in. The Specification 
incorporates Community Home Care for people who require an appropriate level of 
support and/or personal care and meet the Council`s eligibility criteria under: 
The Care Act, Care and Support (Eligibility Criteria) Regulations 2014 (the 
�Eligibility Regulations�). The threshold is based on identifying how a 
person�s needs affect their ability to achieve relevant outcomes, and how this 
impacts on their wellbeing.  
The Specification introduces and requires new ways of working. The Council 
is keen to work with Service Providers to achieve the requirements in the 
Specification and to negotiate ways to deliver the specified outcomes. We 
welcome innovative approaches that add value and improve the quality of local, 
Community Home Care for people with eligible needs.

years.

Lot 1 Black African Communities (BAC) 
Lot 2 Men that have Sex with Men (MSM) 
� 
Background 
� 
Sexual health is an important area of Public Health. Most of the adult 
population of England are sexually active and access to quality sexual health 
services improves the health and wellbeing of both individuals and 
populations. 
� 
Sexual ill health is not equally distributed within the population. STI 
rates including HIV infection in the UK disproportionately affects MSM and 
Black Africans. Some groups at higher risk of poor sexual health face stigma 
and discrimination, which can influence their ability to access services.  
� 
In 2011, 1,062 residents of Leeds received HIV treatment and care. This 
figure is broken down into acquired infection routes as 27% sex between men, 
69% heterosexual with the remaining 4% via intravenous drug use, blood products 
and mother to child transmission routes. 
 
It is estimated that 2.7% of adult males aged 15-49 have genital contact 
with another man in an urban population (CHAPS, 2003:09). When applied 
to the Leeds 15-49 male population this gives an approximate estimate of 5,751 
men engaging in sex with other men in the City. If we look at the full male 
population (15+ 304,200) this gives us a slightly higher estimate of 8,213 as a 
group defined as MSM. 
� 
In Yorkshire and the Humber, 52 per 100,000 people of Black African or 
Caribbean ethnicity are living with the infection in comparison to 4 per 
100,000 people of white ethnicity living with HIV. 
� 
HIV is a long term medical condition and for many is effectively managed via 
treatment. Early diagnosis plays a massive role in both the quality of life for 
the individual and the prevention agenda, heavily reducing the likelihood of 
onward transmission and improving the health outcomes for those testing 
positive. Knowing their status also helps them gain access to further 
knowledge, resources and skills that can help improve their overall health and 
wellbeing.

Leeds City Council,http://opendatacommunities.org/id/metropolitan-district-council/leeds,19/06/2017,DN206607 (CONTRACT-YORE-96TER5),Integrated Sexual Health Service,Public Health,"Background 
Leeds City Council is mandated to commission �open access� sexual health 
services. National direction recommends that sexual health services should be 
reconfigured or remodelled to meet the service user�s needs. A series of 
consultations in Leeds has identified clearly what service users now want and 
expect from services.� This will require the integration of sexual health 
services.  
The key feature of integration is that it will provide contraception and 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) 
testing in one visit. This will eliminate the need for multiple services, 
remove duplication and provide an opportunity for the optimum sharing of skills 
and resources. Using this approach will significantly improve the service user 
experience. 
An integrated sexual health service will also lead to better health outcomes 
by reducing unintended conceptions and by reducing the amount of sexually 
transmitted infections in the population. 
Scope of this procurement 
Leeds City Council is seeking to procure an integrated sexual health service 
for Leeds, offering both contraception and Human Immunodeficiency Virus / 
Sexually Transmitted Infections (HIV/STI) testing services. Patients will be 
able to access these services through one, holistic appointment.� The 
service will be open access, confidential and patients will experience rapid 
access to appointments. There will also be a focus on triaging patients to the 
most appropriate level of care. The integrated service will provide a city 
centre hub, plus clinics in areas with the highest rates of poor sexual health 
as indicated in the Leeds Joint Strategic Needs Assessment. The service will be 
delivered in broad accordance with the Level 1, 2 and 3 service model which is 
well established for sexual health service provision. 
The service will provide a leadership role in sexual health within the local 
area and work with all other relevant clinical and non-clinical sexual health 
and healthcare providers to support seamless service provision and health 
promotion. Prevention will be a key priority for the service.  
Key service outcomes 
The service will support delivery against the three main sexual health 
Public Health Outcome Framework measures:�  
 
 Under 18 conceptions 
 Chlamydia diagnoses (15-24 year olds) 
 People presenting with HIV at a late stage of infection 
 
In addition it will deliver the following outcomes to improve sexual health 
in the Leeds population as a whole:  
 
 Improved access to services among those at highest risk of sexual ill 
health 
 Reduced sexual health inequalities amongst young people and young adults 

 Reduced sexual health inequalities amongst BME and MSM groups 
 Reduced unplanned pregnancies by increasing the uptake of effective 
methods of contraception. 
 Increased diagnosis and effective management of sexually transmitted 
infections 
 Increased uptake of HIV testing with particular emphasis on first time 
service users and repeat testing of those that remain at risk 
 Improved quality across all sexual health services in Leeds through 
clinical leadership",01/07/2015,30/06/2020,30/12/2019,,30/06/2020,12,0,"�29,256,575.00",�0.00,Please view tab 2 on excel sheet,Kate Daly,Not provided,No,N/A,"integrated, sexual, health, gum, cash, health"

Leeds City Council,http://opendatacommunities.org/id/metropolitan-district-council/leeds,19/06/2017,DN206696 (CONTRACT-YORE-973C5K),LCCITS120023: Supply of an eRecruitment system,Business Support Centre,"The Business Support Centre (BSC) is a provider of shared services, 
providing support services to Leeds City Council, its immediate partners and 
beyond. BSC customers include employees within all directorates, schools, arm�s 
length management organisations (ALMOs) and a number of colleges and other 
external organisations. The service ensures the Council meets its statutory 
requirements with regard to PAYE, pensions, employment checks and payment of 
bills. The recruitment process is also supported by the HR Resources Team who 
manages the internal redeployment pool. 
The service utilises an eRecruitment solution to facilitate the electronic 
capture of application forms and to offer a web based service for vacancies. 
This solution has been in place for 7 years and is in need of replacement. The 
service would like to take this opportunity to increase the functionality 
currently available and to devolve a large part of the process to business 
managers. 
Recruitment involves a series of activities and processes which support 
vacancy fulfilment. The introduction of a new eRecruitment solution provides an 
opportunity for these processes to be reviewed and move towards a more devolved 
service featuring increased self-service. 
The principle objective is to replace the existing eRecruitment service with 
a new service enabling cashable savings and efficiencies to be realised. The 
Council is looking to achieve this through a hosted solution. 
Outline Requirements 
eRrecruitment software is a vital part of any recruitment process, providing 
HR and business managers with the tools and capacity to deliver time and cost 
effective resourcing. Suppliers should have a demonstrable track record in 
delivering solutions which meet the Council�s outline requirements: 
Candidates 
Candidates should be able to:  
 
 build and maintain a candidate Profile;  
 apply for live vacancies;  
 attach CV�s, cover letters, academic transcripts and any other relevant 
documentation;  
 subscribe to automated job alerts, which are personalised to their 
requirements or interests;  
 provide full application details for �speculative� or �future 
opportunities�, i.e. not just applying for a �general application�;  
 manage, accept and decline invitations to interviews; and  
 view saved copies of all correspondences from the prospective employer in 
a personalised mail section.  
 
Recruitment Service and Business Managers 
Officers within the Business Support Centre and business managers should be 
able to:  
 
 manage both online and email based requisition approvals processes;  
 co-ordinate all advertising and workflow of vacancies between relevant 
points � corporate vacancies, intranet, external agencies;  
 issue automatic or manual candidate acknowledgements at any stage of the 
recruitment process;  
 filter, screen and score candidates according to application responses; 
 
 tailor their application processes for any type of recruitment � contract, 
permanent, full or part time, Graduate etc.;  
 manage all interviews online with the ability for candidates to 
self-schedule;  
 manage all candidate communications, e.g. offers of employment; and  
 report on all aspects of the recruitment process easily with no advanced 
skills in general software applications, e.g. spread sheets.  
 
General Solution Requirements 
 
 integrate with the Councils HR and Payroll system � SAP;  
 support access for a range external providers e.g. schools and academies; 
 
 support a range of pre-employment checks;  
 the initial stages of a strategy on �whole workforce talent pool� are 
emerging, but the concept has not yet been fully developed. However core to 
this approach is the concept of �job matching� which is when the system 
automatically matches suitable employees\applicants with available roles based 
on skills profiling and the Council is keen to explore how this approach may be 
adopted and may deploy a talent management solution; and  
 the e-recruitment solution should� support and integrate with a 
talent management solution� with skills profile and job matching;

services. 
Leeds Community Equipment Service (LCES) provides the right equipment 
quickly to enable people to live independent inclusive lives. �It is an 
integrated service delivering all aspects of equipment for health and local 
authority customers of all ages in Leeds. 
LCES oversees all aspects of relevant staff training, information and advice 
to actual and potential users of equipment, service development and the 
storage, delivery, installation, collection and cleaning of community 
equipment.� Equipment is delivered and installed in homes at the request 
of a range of people who assess patients' needs, such as occupational 
therapists, district nurses, physiotherapists and others. The equipment is also 
delivered to hospitals and other stores to be taken to service users� 
homes. 
LCES currently uses a system for stock control management, which is no 
longer being developed or supported. Although the LCES is a joint store with 
the NHS, the current system can only be accessed by LCC Adult Social Care 
staff. �The Council is, therefore, looking to procure a solution that is 
accessible to non-Council staff. 
The Telecare service currently uses a standalone system called TOM to manage 
its stock and are looking to migrate data from TOM to the new solution. This 
will consolidate all stock management in one product, with the associated 
benefits that use and funding of one solution will bring. 
The Manager of the LCES and Telecare services is looking to modernise the 
way in which the two services operate (electronic referrals by all referrers), 
and therefore requires a solution which will support these - and other - 
changes. The key requirement is for all referrers (District Nurses, Health 
Occupational Therapists (OTs), Adult Social Care (ASC) OTs and Social Workers) 
to be able to log requests directly on the system, negating the need to fax or 
phone through requests. Referrers will also be able to track the progress of 
referrals on the system. 
Scope  
The LCES requires a solution that will support the modernisation of the 
service and will meet its long term needs.  
 
 The Supplier will be responsible for the installation and commissioning of 
the solution, as well as providing training and associated user documentation, 
as well as any relevant technical documentation that will assist LCC in 
providing support to users. The Supplier is also required to provide quotes for 
specific hardware, e.g. handheld devices, barcode printers.

HEALTHCARE 
Leeds City Council (LCC) directorate of Adult Social Care have embarked on 
an ambitious modernisation programme in order to improve our information 
management, information sharing and information security. As part of this 
development, the Council is seeking to procure a system for publishing new home 
care packages to a secure website, accessible to predetermined groups of 
homecare providers, thereby supporting the work of a team of officers engaged 
in brokering homecare. 
Adult Social Care currently operates a small team of staff within the �Care 
Communication Centre� to communicate with homecare providers, currently under 
contract, in order to �broker� homecare. The current processes rely heavily on 
worker input, employ only very basic technology and, by their manual nature, 
impose delays on the brokering of care packages. Due to the limitations of the 
technology available to the team, homecare providers seeking work are required 
to engage in a time-consuming process of information gathering and 
authorisation of care packages. 
This object of this tender process is to introduce new technology which will 
replace the inefficient paper, fax and telephone based systems for 
commissioning domiciliary care services, with a web-based system that will 
support greater automation in the commissioning of home care packages. The 
current manual processes are inefficient, yet require considerable 
administrative resource to operate. 
It is anticipated that the use of a website to publish available care 
packages will increase the speed of distribution of care packages, producing a 
positive outcome for homecare service users. The greater data security offered 
by a secure website, accessible only to predetermined groups of homecare 
providers under contract, should facilitate the provision of more detailed care 
package requirements, secure transmission of enquiries, and rapid confirmation 
of acceptance of a care package. 
In summary, the project will deliver: 
 
 A secure, easy to use website, accessible by concurrent users, and 
offering managed access to homecare providers, which holds care package data 
loaded in line with Care Communication Centre processes. 
 A website which is accessible 24/7 and facilitates the Care Communication 
Centre brokerage team management of the process to select the homecare provider 
offering the most suitable service. 
 The capability to securely hold data for multiple care packages for 
publishing to multiple prospective homecare providers, for background sharing 
with care record and monitoring systems, and for performance reporting. 
 Improved data management, data security and secure communication at every 
stage during the brokerage process. 
 The facility to automatically generate comprehensive management reports 
regarding the take up and delivery of homecare packages. This will include 
date/time stamping of key events as part of the process to broker care packages 
to providers.",18/11/2015,31/05/2018,01/11/2017,,30/06/2018,9,0,"�148,414.00",�0.00,Please view tab 2 on excel sheet,Jason Lane,Not provided,No,N/A,"Electronic, Brokerage"

provision of ICT services which support the Council and its public service 
partners in delivering key outcomes: either end-to-end projects or key 
components of larger programmes.� The framework will be used on a project 
by project basis to supplement the Council and its partners existing contracts 
and permanent / temporary resource.� It is also a fundamental requirement 
that the framework suppliers effectively work with and up-skill the Council and 
its public service partners own workforce. 
� 
The suppliers appointed to the framework must be capable of operating in a 
flexible, agile manner and it is not expected that a traditional systems 
integration approach would deliver the working relationship required.� We 
would particularly welcome bids from small and medium sized enterprises, either 
as a consortia or as prime contractors that would deliver the requirements 
themselves or sub contract these services to other small to medium enterprises 
that are experts in their field.� We particularly welcome organisations 
that, wherever possible, would support the economic growth of the Leeds City 
Region. 
� 
Due to the project based nature of work that will be undertaken, the Council 
and its public sector partners cannot guarantee any minimum expenditure under 
the framework as each separate project will be subject to its own business case 
and funding.� The anticipated expenditure over the duration of the 
framework is �5,000,000 and the maximum will be �10,000,000.

across the entire ICT Lifecycle covering the Council and its public sector

partnership with a leading Green Deal Provider/consortium in order to offer 
high quality and good value energy efficiency improvements to 
residents.  
The project will cover the whole of the Leeds City Region (and potentially 
parts of N Yorkshire and East Riding) with equal access, value for money and 
terms and conditions for all residents, regardless of location.  
The project will be available to any resident regardless of tenure or 
housing design, construction type, size and fuel type used for heating and hot 
water.  
The project will be open to all private sector households and the winning 
tender will be encouraged to design marketing approaches that the private 
sector will respond to. Many of the LCR housing authorities and housing 
associations have indicated that they are also interested in working with the 
winning tenderer to deliver social housing projects in specific 
estates. These are likely to be predominantly system built properties, 
solid walled Victorian properties and multi-storey blocks and properties with 
narrow cavities.   
Bidders will also be encouraged to consider opportunities within the non 
domestic market. 
The winning tenderer/consortia will have ultimate responsibility for turnkey 
project delivery. Upon appointment, they will be required to market and 
manage a LCR wide private sector Green Deal/ECO scheme. This will provide, 
as a minimum, the following three broad types of offer, to be delivered 
throughout the LCR area:  
A.       Delivery of a free HHCRO 
scheme, including free HHCRO fully GD accredited assessments and installation 
of free HHCRO measures; 
B.       Delivery of a full range of 
Green Deal measures, including Green Deal Assessments, within CSCO areas. This 
will aim to maximise the CSCO component to reduce the cost to households; 
and 
C.       Delivery of a full range of

Leeds City Council,http://opendatacommunities.org/id/metropolitan-district-council/leeds,19/06/2017,DN206396 (CONTRACT-YORE-965BUN),Leeds Directory Service,Adult Social Care,"Background 
� 
With increasing demands on the local authority to provide for people with 
the highest levels of care needs, the �Keeping House� project was established 
in 2005 to create new ways to continue to address basic, but all-important, 
domestic needs of older people and disabled people.  
� 
One of Keeping House�s primary functions was to develop and maintain a list 
of domestic services, which could assist Leeds� strategic objective to help 
older people and disabled people to live independently in their own homes for 
as long as they wish to do so. 
� 
Alongside the Directory, a quality assurance function for domestic providers 
was established. This gave assurance that providers of services in the home or 
garden who were listed in the Directory met specific quality assurance criteria 
to allow them to become �Green Tick� providers. 
� 
Since April 2009, the Keeping House Directory and the Quality Assurance 
function have been contracted out from the local authority to an external 
provider that has developed and run the service. 
� 
In 2010 the directory was rebranded as the �Leeds Directory� and its remit 
expanded to list all services that enabled people to remain independent in 
their own home. The target audience for the directory was also expanded to 
include people with a learning disability and a mental health problem, in-line 
with the personalisation agenda. 
� 
Since its inception the Directory has continued to expand and now lists over 
1,700 organisations and services. 6,721 people accessed the Directory in the 
last month (January 2013 stats) which is an increase of 242 compared to last 
January. 
� 
Leeds Directory provides information on services, but does not allow for 
online purchasing. Alongside the continuing growth of the Leeds Directory, a 
separate website has been developed (Connect to Support Leeds) to allow 
customers to purchase care and support services on line. This is being provided 
as part of a regional project with all the Yorkshire and Humber local 
authorities by an organisation called Shop4Support. 
� 
It is intended that the increasing popularity of the Directory as a method 
for providers advertising services and customers accessing information can be 
harnessed and coupled with the Connect to Support functionality to allow people 
to research and purchase services online. Leeds Directory will continue to 
provide the directory of services available and the quality assurance function, 
while customers will be able to purchase goods and services from the Connect to 
Support site. To allow this to happen, close links will need to be forged and 
maintained between the provider of the Leeds Directory and the provider of the 
Connect to Support site (Shop4Support). 
� 
� 
Scope of the service to be provided 
� 
The aim of the Leeds Directory service is: 
� 
a). To provide, maintain and further develop the Leeds Directory, an online 
Directory of services which support people to remain independent (www.leedsdirectory.org)  
b). To run a Leeds Directory helpline to answer customer queries and give 
customers information on services where they do not have internet access 
c). To provide the Quality Assurance function for services listed in the 
Leeds Directory that deliver services in the home or garden  
� 
� 
d). To ensure links are formed and maintained with the �Connect to Support� 
website which provides customers with the ability to purchase services from 
providers listed on-line 
�

contract will provide the opportunity for the Contractor to access potential 
income of �314,065 per annum (total potential income of �1,570,325 
for the full five years of the contract). This consists of income for the 24/7 
Core service paid directly by tenants (estimated to be �126,215 per 
annum) and potential income from the delivery of planned care and support, 
estimated at �187,850 per annum based on a projected demand of 289 hours 
per week. Demand for the planned care and support element of the contract is 
influenced by the number of hours linked to care packages as well as the number 
of Tenants opting to go with the onsite provider for this support. The 
calculation is also based on the assumption of one person per apartment having 
eligible care and support needs. The care hours are distributed across 35 of 
the 45 apartments, with the final 10 open to shared ownership. There is the 
potential for further business from these apartments in addition to the 
calculations provided above.
